Thick willows and cypress obscure your view off to the sides; just about every branch of every tree seems to drip with Spanish moss. You&#39;ve got your phone set up to record as you drive. 

&quot;So guys, I&#39;m on my way to a, well. A big-ass spooky mansion, just a few miles outside New Orleans. Gonna spend the night, see if I can&#39;t get some good footage of any ghosts hangin&#39; around... if I can get a decent enough signal, I //might// even livestream for a bit! I gotta keep driving though, so I&#39;m gonna cut it for now, yeah?&quot; 

You stop recording, and focus on driving. Soon the road narrows as the trees start to encroach, and you&#39;ve got to slow down or risk running off the road. Moss and branches brush the roof of your car on occasion. 

Up ahead is the swamp, and you see a ramshackle little boathouse. Outside it, leaning against the door, is a thick-bodied bulk of a man. He waves at you. 

[[You park your car and get out.-&gt;Boathouse]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2" name="Boathouse" tags="start" position="986,127" size="100,100">&quot;Well nah, how-do, smol-fry?&quot; says the big guy. &quot;Welcome to Bayou Lourde.&quot; 

You introduce yourself. &quot;You must be Beau?&quot; 

&quot;Beau Dubois, yessir that&#39;s me,&quot; Beau smiles. You shake his hand, which dwarfs yours. He&#39;s got that thick accent and his voice is a bit gruff, but up close you can see he&#39;s not that much older than you. &quot;Boat&#39;s fulla gas and ready to go, nah you said you was only stayin&#39; the one night yeah?&quot; 

&quot;That&#39;s the plan,&quot; you nod. &quot;I&#39;ll get ahold of you if that changes.&quot; 

&quot;Well I&#39;mma warn you lil fren,&quot; Beau rubs his chin as he speaks. &quot;There ain&#39;t gonna be good reception way out there. The boathouse on the island though, there&#39;s a radio you should be able to use. I got one in this boathouse too, but mind you I won&#39;t be hangin&#39; around here all day. Early mornin&#39;s when I like to head out fishin&#39; so that&#39;s a good time to get ahold of me.&quot; Beau then gestures towards the boathouse. &quot;Head on in and have a seat, we&#39;ll have you over there in twenty minutes.&quot; 

&quot;Ok cool.&quot; You enter the little shack and see an airboat, which [[you step carefully onto.-&gt;The Ride Over]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="3" name="The Ride Over" tags="start" position="1102,133" size="100,100">The air boat is a little too noisy to have a proper conversation-- it&#39;s mostly Beau pointing around the swamp and yelling about things like, his favorite fishing spots, or where he caught that alligator that one time. You&#39;re glad you doused yourself in Off! beforehand because the mosquitoes are like kamikaze planes, even at this speed. 

There&#39;s a primordial beauty to the swamp all around; the frogs and bugs and birds are a constant symphony of chirps and tweets and songs. It&#39;s a very unique place, very //wild// seeming. Small stumps of wood stick up from the water all over. You see at least two alligators, and in the dimming light, their eyes are starting to gleam ominously. 

The island comes into view soon enough. There&#39;s yet another dilapidated-looking shack sitting on the water&#39;s edge, and Beau steers the airboat right inside. &quot;Haw haw, that&#39;s gotta be a new record,&quot; you hear him say as the huge fan winds down. &quot;I&#39;d be damned if I ain&#39;t got the fastest airboat for a hundred miles, I guarantee.&quot; 

You step outside the boathouse and take a look around. Through the thick trees and bushes, you can just see the [[vast plantation up ahead.-&gt;The Approach]] </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="4" name="The Approach" tags="start" position="1230,132" size="100,100">&quot;Say there lil fren,&quot; Beau calls as you start walking towards the house. &quot;You sure you won&#39; be needin&#39; this, huh?&quot; and he holds up a break-action shotgun. 

&quot;I sure hope not,&quot; you say with a grin. &quot;If anything happens to me, there&#39;s about 900,000 people who know where I&#39;m gonna be tonight, so...&quot; 

Beau whistles. &quot;Hot damn, son. You got almost a million subscribers? I got like... twenty on my fishin&#39; channel, haw haw. Hey, we could take a few pictures together, yeah?&quot; 

Hey, why not? You both pull out your phones and take a few pics together. He seems excited at the prospect of picking up some subscribers from you. &quot;Now uhh, listen. Once I get back on that boat, I won&#39;t be back until tomorrow evenin&#39;, unless I hear you on the radio. It&#39;s already set to the right frequency, so don&#39;t be messin&#39; with all the knobs, yeah?&quot; 

He studies you a minute; as if he doesn&#39;t think you&#39;re up to this. &quot;You sure you wanna stay then, huh? Last chance to back out.&quot; 

[[&quot;Yeah man, I&#39;m sure. Thanks for the ride.-&gt;Stay]]

[[&quot;Do you have a good reason why I should leave?-&gt;Question Beau]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="5" name="Stay" tags="start" position="1375,168" size="100,100">&quot;Well alright then. Hey watch out for //rougarou,// haw haw.&quot; Beau grins down at you, then shakes your hand one last time. Then you pull out $50 in cash and pass it to him. 

&quot;Half now, half later,&quot; you remind him. It might seem a little exorbitant, but you usually get a decent amount of views, and your subscriber count grows at a fairly steady rate. $100 is just a minor business expense these days. You&#39;ll recover it in no time. 

You head up an overgrown path, through what used to be a fancy iron gate. It&#39;s now hanging off the hinges and squeaking incessantly with every gust of wind. Above you looms the antebellum facade lined with columns and laced with ivy. You approach the huge front door. There&#39;s a lovely, intricate set of carvings inlaid into the lacquered wood, but then you realize that it&#39;s actually super-fancy lettering. 

**Le Manoir De Remplissage**

Yep, this is definitely the place. You could find next to nothing on the Internet about this place, so hopefully soon you&#39;ll be able to shed some light on its mysteries. It&#39;s a gorgeous mansion, barring the damage of hundreds of years of weathering of course. It&#39;s pretty much the closest thing you&#39;re gonna get to &#39;ancient ruins&#39; here in America. 

You spend a few minutes taking some pictures and video, then [[step inside-&gt;Enter Foyer]]. </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="6" name="Question Beau" tags="start" position="1347,17" size="100,100">&quot;Well naw, it&#39;s just, most of us from around here, we don&#39; like this place much,&quot; Beau shrugs. He smiles though. &quot;There&#39;s enough ghost stories in this here swamp to spend a week around a fire tellin&#39;. It&#39;s all the worst stereotypes o&#39; Louisiana, smol fren, all rolled into one big fat package haw haw.&quot; 

You pull your phone out and hit record, but don&#39;t mention it to him and pretend to be trying to access the Internet. &quot;Yeah, you know there&#39;s really next to no information about this place, just like, two articles. And you&#39;re right, I can&#39;t even access them from here.&quot; 

Beau takes the bait. &quot;Well, there&#39;s, lemme see. There was a slave what poisoned their owners, so the story goes; you might see their ghost up in there. I //believe// a voodoo queen shacked up in here not too long ago, as well.&quot; 

&quot;Well is she still around? And is she a threat?&quot; you chuckle. 

&quot;Well nah, like most witches, if you run into one, you just be polite and treat &#39;em with respect like you would anyone, and they PROBABLY won&#39;t put a hex on ya.&quot; Beau rubs his chin. &quot;Is she still around, though. That&#39;s a good question.&quot; 

&quot;I&#39;ll let you know,&quot; you say. 

He nods, trying to think of more things to tell you. &quot;And o&#39;course there be rougarou everywhere, haw haw,&quot; he shakes with laughter. &quot;Can&#39;t have a spook story in a bayou without a rougarou sooner or later.&quot; 

You consider his words for a few seconds, then answer: 

[[&quot;Nah, I&#39;m definitely staying, my dude.-&gt;Stay]] No turning back now.&quot;

[[&quot;Actually I think... I&#39;ll call this off for now,-&gt;Try to Leave]] but maybe I&#39;ll come back in a few days with a buddy or two.&quot; </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="7" name="Try to Leave" tags="rougarou" position="1507,56" size="100,100">&quot;Hmm? Well alright then,&quot; Beau says with a shrug. &quot;I wish I&#39;d known you was gonna chicken out-- no offense,&quot; he says. 

You roll your eyes and start walking back to the boathouse. &quot;Hahaha, trust me man, I&#39;m not chickening out, but I&#39;m not gonna ask you to spend your valuable time babysitting me when I could just call one or two of my buddies to come make a camping trip of it.&quot; 

&quot;Hmmm. //Babysitter.// Shoo, we might need wonna those, soon, I guarantee,&quot; Beau grunts. 

Something about his tone makes you glance back at him, and then you turn full-on to face him as you realize he&#39;s growing. Fast. Beau&#39;s already beefy body is getting absolutely massive; his overalls are splitting around his thickening waistline and the straps are snapping off his bulging, swelling shoulders. 

He lumbers closer to you. &quot;Haw haw. It&#39;s no problem at all though, smol fren,&quot; he says. His voice is getting deeper and gruffer. You see a beard growing on his face and lots and LOTS of hair sprouting all over his exposed skin. &quot;I would be //happy// to stay here with you tonight. Haw haw.&quot; 

&quot;What. The FUCK??&quot; you whisper. You aim your phone at him; it&#39;s still recording, and you get some footage of his transformation. 

&quot;I //did// tell you to watch out for //le rougarou,// didn&#39;t I?&quot; he chortles as a whole bunch of terrifying fangs fill his mouth. &quot;Haw haw. Haw. Hawhawhaw. Hey c&#39;mere smol fren.&quot; 

Beau is turning into a huge, hairy werewolf or something, and you&#39;d better fuckin&#39; run! But to where?? 

[[Dodge around him and head for the mansion-&gt;Oh Yeah Right]]

[[Make a break for the airboat-&gt;Early Back Boathouse]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="8" name="Early Back Boathouse" tags="rougarou" position="1636,10" size="100,100">You bolt for the rickety little shack on the edge of the swamp. It&#39;s your only way off the island that won&#39;t end up with you in some gator&#39;s gut... or Beau&#39;s! Hopefully you can beat him there. He seems... immensely heavier than before, so you just have to run, and get inside the door, and hope he won&#39;t //fit// with all his new bulk-- 

HOLY CRAP his massive fist smashes the door in. &quot;Why you runnin&#39;? //Why? Are? You? Runnin&#39;?// Haw hawhaw. Smol fren do you even know how to start up that there boat der?&quot; Beau guffaws. 

You jump on the boat, fuck, you don&#39;t know how to start an airboat!! Didn&#39;t he pull a ripcord or something? 

Beau attempts to squeeze through the doorframe. Fuck, he&#39;s like 10 feet tall and built like a gorilla. Except... more of a werewolf feel of course. That must be what &#39;rougarou&#39; means in French. 

You find a lever. Nope, that&#39;s the rudder. What about this handle? You pull on it. Yes! This is a ripcord, indeed. You pull it again. 

It&#39;s not fucking working!! 

You hear a little jingly noise by your left ear, and cringe in terror. 

Beau&#39;s jingling the keys above you. &quot;You uhh, lookin&#39; for these mah fren?&quot; 

&quot;Oh fuck,&quot; you wheeze. 

Beau&#39;s gigantic hands grab ahold of you before you can do anything. You kick and scream and squirm and swing your arms and flail about... he [[carries you out of the boathouse.-&gt;Scaredy-Cat End]] </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="9" name="Oh Yeah Right" tags="rougarou" position="1636,119" size="100,100">You reason that since Beau&#39;s in the middle of a werebeast transformation, he&#39;s probably going to be twitching about and not in full control of himself yet. So you pretend like you&#39;re going to run one direction, and then jump sideways and sprint for the plantation house. 

Except you don&#39;t, because a massive burly arm swings out and catches you around the waist, and just like that you&#39;re lifted off the ground. You slam into Beau&#39;s hulking chest and grunt as his thick arms compress around you. 

&quot;Haw haw, I&#39;ve caught me a new slippery lil fish, haw haw,&quot; Beau chuckles. &quot;Where did y&#39;all think you was goin&#39;, huh?&quot; 

Ffffuck. You can feel his body, his arms, growing all around you. His arms are crushing you tight against his huge bulk. You can feel his //fur// growing in, brushing against your head. His voice vibrates against your back. 

&quot;Here now, let Beau take you to his favorite spot on the island, yeah?&quot; 

and just like that you&#39;re being [[carried away from the only means of escape you had.-&gt;Scaredy-Cat End]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="10" name="Scaredy-Cat End" tags="badend RG" position="1764,48" size="100,100">Your struggles are completely useless, and all you do is exhaust yourself. There&#39;s no escaping Beau&#39;s bulging, furry werewolf arms. He holds you nice and tight and carries you into the house, up a flight of stairs... up another flight of stairs. And one more, this time in a spiral. You&#39;re now at the very top of the plantation, in a small, open-air cupola. 

&quot;Hawhaw, this yere lil cupola, lets you see the Bayou for //miles// ma cher.&quot; 

&quot;If you&#39;re going to kill me...&quot; you take a shivering breath. &quot;Just. Make it quick. Please don&#39;t make me suffer.&quot; 

&quot;Oh?? Ohohoho. Ha! HAAA! Hahaha. Hawhaw. Haw.&quot; Beau&#39;s laughter shakes you like a maraca. &quot;Kill you? What would I do with the body, eat it? You ain&#39;t got enough meat on your bones to even qualify as a snack. But. You //are// a lil snack though.&quot; He licks his lips above your head, and you can hear his tongue sliding over sharp teeth. 

&quot;Naw. I get plenty to eat from Mammy Violette downstairs,&quot; Beau says. You hear a small slap, like he just patted his gut. &quot;You eat her food too long, you&#39;ll sink the airboat. Won&#39; be a smol fren much longer, hawhaw!&quot; 

You feel a sharp claw at your back, and it travels down your spine, and... and oh fuck, it hooks into the waistband of your jeans, and tugs them away from your back, and you hear Beau sniff. 

&quot;Mmm. Mm. That&#39;s a good smell. We gonna make plenty good babies here tonight, I guarantee.&quot; 

You go cold and rigid in his arms. [[&quot;...babies??!?&quot;-&gt;Scaredy-Cat Ending 2]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="11" name="Scaredy-Cat Ending 2" tags="badend RG" position="1894,50" size="100,100">&quot;Mmm. Babies. Cute lil rougarou pups, yeah. Haven&#39;t made nunna those in awhile.&quot; Beau bends you over one of his arms like he&#39;s draping wet clothes on a line, and you feel his big hand feeling your crotch-- actually, your button and zipper. His fingers are nimble enough, despite their size, to undo your pants without damaging them. 

You&#39;re about to get fucked. 
Saints alive you&#39;re about to get fucked by a fucking huge fucking Cajun werewolf redneck BEAST THING and there is absolutely nothing you can do about it. 

You can&#39;t escape. You can&#39;t fight him. You can&#39;t even clench up adequately as his fat pecker probes at your hole and gushes pre all over, before shoving in hard with a noisy //scchhhlllURP// sound. Your body spazzes and twitches. You can&#39;t even //scream,// it just comes out in sharp little gasps and chokes and squeaks. 

&quot;There there ma cher, it&#39;s ok. I may be a big monster yeah, but I&#39;m also a proper Southern boy, I&#39;mma treat you right while you grow me some big healthy pups.&quot; Beau&#39;s gigantic warm hand pats your stomach. 

&quot;HOW THE--&quot; you manage to choke out. &quot;I. AM. A MAN.&quot; 

&quot;Well so am I, smol fren!&quot; Beau chortles. He&#39;s barely even... thrusting. Just slowly pushing his huge cock in deeper and deeper. &quot;But I&#39;m also a rougarou. So. That&#39;s how.&quot; 

... apparently that&#39;s all there is to it. Beau&#39;s muscles tighten up all around you, but then he reaches back behind himself, and... 

[[and he pulls out his mother. fucking. phone.-&gt;Scaredy-Cat Ending 3]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="12" name="Scaredy-Cat Ending 3" tags="badend RG" position="2027,46" size="100,100">&quot;Awwright, here we go now, &#39;bout to be the money shot smol fren!&quot; Beau clamps one beefy arm around your chest to hold you upright. His other arm extends out with his phone aimed at the pair of you. &quot;We gonnna make a //beautiful// video for your channel too. Million people gonna watch you get pregnant, I guarantee!&quot; 

You can&#39;t keep the horrified look off your face. &quot;Nonono man, don&#39;t... don&#39;t do this!!&quot; And you can&#39;t keep your eyes off the phone camera. 

&quot;Who&#39;s my lil smol fren, huh?&quot; Beau croons in your ear. 

&quot;...&quot; you clamp your mouth shut, whimpering quietly. 

Beau shoves in deeper and you nearly pass out when you feel his schlong press against a very, VERY sensitive spot deep in your belly. &quot;Who&#39;s. My. Smol. Fren.&quot; 

&quot;AHHhahHAHHH I AM I AM I AM YOUR SMALL FRIEND.&quot; SUddenly you&#39;re harder than you&#39;ve ever been in your entire life. It&#39;s like he flipped a switch inside you. 

&quot;Hawhawhaw, that&#39;s right you are,&quot; Beau says. And then you feel it. Holy fuck, you feel it. Great big gobs of hot cum, punching your belly from the inside, bursting into you like a levee breaking. Gushing. Flowing. You can almost //hear// it. Bloop, bloop, bloop, blub, blub. 

The camera records every moment of it, from your panicked squirming, your own unwanted orgasm, and your begging gasps... and Beau even lowers the camera down so everyone can watch your abdomen begin to grow. His cum. Doesn&#39;t. Stop. Flowing. It forces itself into every nook and cranny, runs out of room, and begins expanding your belly. You bloat and grow and swell and distend. 

Beau howls in pleasure. &quot;I think I&#39;mma keep you around, a long time smol fren. You gonna have LOTSA babies.&quot; 

And his hands caress your bulging belly, and you whimper and sob, and go limp in his vast furry embrace. You feel something squirming inside your gut, and then a little flutter, a little bump inside... 

***END*** 

You belong to Beau the Rougarou now. He keeps you safe and comfortable but until you grow yourself some huge muscles of your own to fight him off with, you&#39;re going to spend a very long time being pregnant, or fucked, or both. The little werewolf pups come out the same way they got in, and Beau&#39;s quick to breed you again after each birth, keeping you in a constant state of bloating and ballooning with babies... 

eventually you almost forget what you look like with a flat stomach. 

and the big fucker posts the video too, and now the entire fucking Internet gets to watch you getting plowed whenever they want! </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="13" name="Enter Foyer" tags="hub-area" position="1352,320" size="100,100">You&#39;re standing in what was once a foyer lined with potted plants and statuary. The statues are all broken and crumbling now, and there&#39;s only pots left. A shredded runner rug lies along the ground, leading to a **staircase** you might explore. 

Off to the left you see a **dining room**. Past the stairs is a **hallway** with some old paintings hanging up. Looking right, you see the **living room** with an empty fireplace and some sheet-draped furniture. 

You&#39;ll need to explore around and take both pictures and video, along with narrating as you see fit. You&#39;ll also want to find a comfy place to sleep, perhaps in a bedroom upstairs. You don&#39;t really need to unpack anything; since you&#39;re just staying the one night, all you&#39;ve got is your phone, your wallet, your car keys, and your clothes. 

A floor-length [[mirror-&gt;Foyer Reflection]] is available for you to inspect yourself with. 

&quot;Well guys, here I am, in this big spooky plantation. Supposedly there&#39;s tons of weird shit that&#39;s gone on around here, so. I&#39;m hoping to get some footage of it. Reception&#39;s bad here so unfortunately no live-streaming. I&#39;m so excited though, you guys! You really don&#39;t, you //can&#39;t,// understand the thrill of being in a place like this all alone, until you&#39;ve just. Done it.&quot; You get some more shots of your surroundings, then put your phone away. 

Time to do some exploring! Where to first? 

Check out the [[Dining Room]].

Head for the [[Living Room-&gt;Living Room Earlier]].

Walk down the [[Hallway]] past the stairs. 

Or head [[Upstairs-&gt;Upstairs (False)]].  </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="14" name="Dining Room" tags="" position="885,30" size="100,100">You enter an opulently-furnished dining room. At one end are tall, beautiful windows. You can imagine waking up in the morning to a delicious breakfast, sitting with your family, looking out at your estate through these windows. 

There&#39;s of course, a long dining table with chairs all around it. On the table and a few chairs, you see some scratches-- deep ones, almost like claw marks. Some of the chairs are damaged as well; at least one looks utterly pancaked as if a heavy weight was dropped onto it. 

At the other end of the dining room you can see a set of double-doors. One of them is cracked open and you&#39;re fairly certain beyond it lies the **Kitchen**. 

After taking some pics and video, you reason there&#39;s not much else to do here. You can either head on into the kitchen, or turn back and explore somewhere else. 

So you: 

[[Enter the kitchen.-&gt;Kitchen]] 

[[Head back to the main foyer.-&gt;Enter Foyer]] </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="15" name="Living Room Earlier" tags="" position="1566,329" size="100,100">The living room is a dusty mess; probably a good representative of the plantation as a whole. Each item in this room has been somewhat preserved by the dingy sheets draped over them-- they may have once been a clean white, but dust has rendered them dull and musty. You get some pictures and a few seconds of video. You can already see the edits, the cuts, how you&#39;re going to splice all this video together. 

&quot;So here I am in uhh, //Le Manoir De Remplissage//,&quot; you attempt-- French words can sometimes confuse your tongue, but you think you got it right. &quot;Not sure what that means, where my French subscribers at? Someone look that up ok?&quot; You lift a few of the sheets to show off what the furniture looks like, and put them back carefully. It&#39;s that sturdy, long-lasting old-school antique style. Colonial or Victorian or whatever. Fancy shit with the ornate wood carvings all over and the colorful cushions... 

And a very nice, marble-carved fireplace. Nothing but ashes in it though. You consider for a second, finding some wood and lighting a fire-- but then you remember you have nothing to light a fire WITH, and... would hate to set the place on fire. Who knows how long it&#39;s been since the chimney was properly swept after all. 

The amount of dust in the house certainly makes everything seem darker. It&#39;s gonna be pitch-black in here in a few hours; it&#39;s already pretty faded and you wish you&#39;d brought an actual dedicated flashlight instead of assuming you&#39;d be able to rely on your phone for everything. 

&quot;So... any ghosts around? How y&#39;all doin&#39;?&quot; you ask, feeling slightly dumb as usual, because let&#39;s face it: you&#39;ve asked this question before, and usually get little to no response from all the hoax and prank ghosts. Let alone any REAL ones. 

You take a moment to listen. The house settles and... seems to breathe. Small creaks and cracks. The usual old house stuff. You&#39;ve heard it all a million times; it used to startle you, but no more. You shut your phone&#39;s recording off for now. 

There&#39;s not much else to see in here, at this time. Up ahead, across the room, is an open archway leading into what looks like a parlor of sorts-- more furniture draped with sheets, but there&#39;s at least some sort of desk in there... maybe it&#39;s a primitive office space? [[You could check it out.-&gt;Parlor]]

Or, hey. Nothing says you can&#39;t head back across the hall and inspect the [[dining room-&gt;Dining Room]] you saw earlier. </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="16" name="Hallway" tags="" position="1300,467" size="100,100">You have your phone aimed in front of you as you walk down the hall past the stairs. You get some neat pictures of the artwork hanging on the walls. There&#39;s some faded paintings still intact, like that one of the Confederate soldier over there-- a strapping young man actually, about your age. Maybe even younger. 

You don&#39;t have time to wonder what his life was like though: up ahead, you can see clear out the back of the plantation, where the door leading to the back porch is //wide open// to the elements. And more importantly... 

You can hear something outside. 
Something with heavy footsteps, and making some... bestial growling noises. Something big, and predatorial. 
ffffuck. What was that word Beau had used? &#39;Roo-ga-roo&#39;? What the fuck does that... mean... 

A dark shape begins to climb the steps up the back porch. It&#39;s about... fifty feet up ahead, at the end of this long hallway. You nearly freeze in fear. Whatever it is, it&#39;s about to come in the house, and if you&#39;re still standing here it&#39;s GOING to see you. You look around. There&#39;s... it&#39;s just a hallway. Only two ways to run, and one of those ways leads straight into the maw of THAT thing... 

fuck, it almost sounds like it&#39;s chuckling quietly to itself. Huffing, snuffling like a big bear. 

If you turn and run now, [[you might just make it!-&gt;Run Hall RG Start]] 

Yet, as you look around the corner to the right, you can see that there&#39;s a door open under the stairs! It&#39;s dark, and might be the perfect [[place to hide,-&gt;Hall RG Hide]] but there&#39;s an even greater risk that creature might see you... </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="17" name="Upstairs (False)" tags="false" position="1184,311" size="100,100">You step lightly up the stairs. For some reason you don&#39;t feel like exploring the lower floors just yet? Maybe you&#39;re just fuckin&#39; tired. It&#39;s been a long week of preparations for this trip. You&#39;re in the mood to just kick back for a bit. 

There&#39;s... a small noise downstairs, that you barely hear as you reach the top. You stop and listen. Was it just your imagination? It almost sounded like a door creaking open. 

Why don&#39;t you go [[check it out?-&gt;Enter Foyer]] You&#39;re here to HUNT ghosts, not let them come to you... right? 

Then again, there&#39;s plenty of ambush hunters in the animal kingdom, right? Haha. You could set up in one of the bedrooms and rest your eyes for a bit, and the moment something goes bump in the night, launch your attack-- with your phone camera of course. 

Do you... [[wanna go to bed?-&gt;Bedtime]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="18" name="Kitchen" tags="mammy" position="766,13" size="100,100">As soon as you enter the large tile-floored kitchen, you pull your phone out and start recording, because SOMETHING went down in here. It&#39;s a mess. There&#39;s just... smashed things. Everywhere. Plates, bowls, crockery, cups, saucers. Cutlery stuck in the walls and stains all over. 

&quot;Alright you guys, check this out...&quot; you narrate quietly. &quot;This is the kitchen obviously. Someone... had a fight in here or something, yeah? Look at all this-- SHIT.&quot; 

You hear a noise and immediately duck behind an open pantry door. You&#39;re not alone here, are you?! The realization arouses your fear as a reflex, but you squash it quickly: if you&#39;re not alone, then you&#39;ve got //views// as long as you can get some good footage. 

Your body prickles all over with chills as you hear the voice of a woman, floating through the room. She&#39;s... singing. You&#39;re not sure you&#39;ve ever heard the song: 

//&quot;If you get there before I do/ Coming for to carry me home/ Tell all of my friends, that I&#39;m coming there too/ Coming for to carry me ho--&quot; //

The singing stops. You peek out from behind the door. &quot;Now who the sam hill been up in MY kitchen, makin&#39; an ungodly mess like this?&quot; 

She&#39;s wide and robust, clad in a do-rag, black clothes and a white apron. She&#39;s also a ghost. Her foggy white-grey skin must have once been much darker. 

[[She doesn&#39;t seem to notice you.-&gt;Kitchen Event]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="19" name="Kitchen Event" tags="mammy" position="629,22" size="100,100">Hot damn, there&#39;s a real-life ghost floating in front of you. Er, not real-//life// but you get the idea. She&#39;s tutting and huffing and plodding about the place, reaching down for the shattered plates and such, miming picking them up... but nothing seems to be happening? Still, she holds her apron out as if she&#39;s collecting pieces in it, and then moves to another pile and picks up... nothing. 

Speaking of nothing, it&#39;s time to do YOUR job, so, here goes it: You step out from your hiding spot and give her a little wave. &quot;Hi there,&quot; you say in a calm, peaceful voice. 

&quot;WHOO HEAVEN&#39;S SAKES CHILE!!&quot; she squeals and jumps back, clutching her apron shut around her &#39;collection.&#39; &quot;I thought you was a ghost! Whassa matter with you all, comin&#39; out and scarin&#39; me like that??&quot; 

&quot;I&#39;m sorry,&quot; you say. &quot;I just uhh... wait, you thought /I/ was a ghost?&quot; 

&quot;Well maybe not a //ghost,// heheh,&quot; she chuckles. &quot;But you&#39;s skinny and bony enough to be blown away by the wind! I better shut these windows &#39;fore that happens.&quot; She first heads to a small wooden pail on the ground and dumps her apron sideways into it (nothing comes out of course), then heads over to the already-closed windows, and mimes closing them. &quot;Now you know I ain&#39;t supposed to serve dinner too early, but if you got business to attend to, I s&#39;pose you could have some now if you want.&quot; 

&quot;I... let me introduce myself, first,&quot; you say. You give her your name. &quot;I&#39;m staying here tonight to investigate paranormal activity.&quot; 

&quot;And what&#39;s that?&quot; she asks, with her hands on her hips. &quot;I never heard of it. How&#39;s it any different than &#39;normal&#39; activity?&quot; 

The irony of this question [[coming from an actual ghost-&gt;Kitchen Event 2]] is not lost on you. </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="20" name="Kitchen Event 2" tags="mammy" position="499,19" size="100,100">&quot;Well, uhmm. Paranormal activity, is that which is caused by... spirits. Ghosts. Uhh.&quot; You smile a little at her wide-eyed expression. &quot;Entities not of this world.&quot; 

&quot;Goodness gracious. Spirits, huh? I didn&#39;t know there was spirits in this house. I hope not. Lord&#39;s sake.&quot; She dusts her ample bosoms off. &quot;Maybe they&#39;re the ones what came in here and made such a miserable mess of the place. By the way I&#39;ve forgotten my manners, sweet chile. My name&#39;s Violette, or otherwise they all call me Mammy Vi &#39;round here.&quot; The large lady smiles warmly at you. &quot;I cook up lots of good food for everyone. That&#39;s... pretty much what I do. How about I fix you some?&quot; 

How about that? You&#39;ve got a ghost offering to make you some ghost food. 

You reply: 

[[&quot;Uhh, well sure, why not?&quot;-&gt;Y-Food Event]] Maybe ghost food tastes good? 

[[&quot;Oh no thank you, I&#39;m not that hungry&quot;-&gt;N-Food Event]] How the hell are you supposed to eat ghost food anyway? </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="21" name="Y-Food Event" tags="mammy" position="379,26" size="100,100">&quot;Ooo good, you&#39;ll love it. Everybody loves my cookin&#39;.&quot; Suddenly on a nearby table you see a ghostly image of a plate piled high with... biscuits and gravy? Sausage, bacon, a cup of coffee, or is that tea? A bowl of grits. A pile of crispy looking hash browns. It&#39;s breakfast for dinner! 

Truth be told you ate a decent meal a few hours ago to make sure you wouldn&#39;t get too ravenous while you were here. And how the hell are you supposed to eat ghost food anyway?? 

Shit. As you stare at the table, you start to see even more food. A plate of pancakes. A shank of ham. A stack of pastries. Ok. Ok. It can&#39;t hurt to... pretend, right? Humor her? 

You sit down on a creaky chair. You reach out and... grasp the transparent fork. You don&#39;t actually feel anything in your hand, but the fork moves in your grip just the same. When you reach out to spear a ghost-biscuit, it looks... right? You just have no tactile responses to let you know that you have indeed stuck a biscuit on the end of your imaginary fork. 

Mammy Vi watches you, delighted, as you dunk it in the gravy and put it up to your mouth. And... and again, it&#39;s so weird, that you don&#39;t //feel// it, but you TASTE it. 

And holy fucking shit. Is it the most delicious thing. You just. The biscuit&#39;s gone. You look down at the plate, drop the fork, reach for another biscuit, and slather that one around in the gravy before biting into it as well. It disappears. You taste all the flavors. Wow. 

You try some of everything. You grab a piece of every food item on the table, one by one, and try it //all.// You don&#39;t feel anything in your hands, ever, no textures or temperatures, but you can taste all of Mammy Vi&#39;s cooking and you want her to follow you home and prepare all of your meals for you. She&#39;s incredible. 

&quot;Heheh. That&#39;ll put some meat on your bones, eh?&quot; she chuckles. &quot;Let me know if you want more.&quot; 

You let out a little whimper. It&#39;s delicious and you DO want more. But you&#39;ve got a job to do first. So you [[pull out your phone-&gt;Y-Food Event 2]]. </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="22" name="N-Food Event" tags="mammy" position="334,165" size="100,100">Mammy Vi scoffs. &quot;Ohh, //nonsense//. I ain&#39;t never met a young man who wasn&#39;t a bottomless pit. Besides, once you try my cookin&#39;, you won&#39;t //EVA// wanna leave the kitchen, chile.&quot; She wears a naughty smirk as she floats closer to you. A delectable-looking, yet completely transparent pastry, appears in her hand. 

Uh oh. 

&quot;Nonono, really,&quot; you say, holding your hands up. &quot;I&#39;m, uhh-- //shit??//&quot; you hiss as for just a split second, Mammy Vi&#39;s face turns utterly HELLISH, all her plump homey sweetness morphing to gaunt undead horror. It last just long enough to startle you into letting her get within arm&#39;s reach of you, and she shoves the ghostly little cake into your mouth. 

What... the fuck?? You had your mouth snapped closed!! She pushed it THROUGH your... teeth... 
Oh wait. Duh. She&#39;s a motherfuckin&#39; GHOST. She can just... pass right through you! You can taste the delightful, rich, buttery pastry in your mouth, and it travels down through your body without you even swallowing. Oddly, you don&#39;t //feel// it in your mouth or throat, you just have the sensation that something is there; an odd little &#39;plopping&#39; in your belly. Apparently that&#39;s how ghostly food works. 

&quot;There. Now ain&#39;t that wonderful?&quot; Mammy grins. &quot;And there&#39;s PLENTY more where that came from chile.&quot; 

&quot;Uhh, no I MEAN yeah, yeah, it was good, uhh, it was very good,&quot; you say, backing up. &quot;Very tasty! UH. Thank you?? I don&#39;t, uhh... //oooo,//&quot; you moan as you suddenly feel... quite full. Holy crap, that was only ONE little ghost cake-thingy. What if... she puts more inside you?? You&#39;re borderline stuffed already! Feels like you just had a stack of pancakes! 

You&#39;ve got to do something, because Mammy Vi has more of those ghost-cakes ready and she&#39;s approaching at a steady pace: 

[[Run around the kitchen island-&gt;N-Food Event Bad 1]] and look for something to defend your stomach with! 

[[Run RIGHT through her,-&gt;N-Food Event Good 1]], it&#39;s the last thing she&#39;ll expect! </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="23" name="Y-Food Event 2" tags="mammy" position="237,27" size="100,100">&quot;You guys. I&#39;m eating GHOST FOOD. And it is. The best. Fucking. Food. Ever.&quot; 

&quot;Hey now you watch your mouth, y&#39;hear?&quot; Mammy Vi says with a little gasp. But she smiles. &quot;And I&#39;m flattered.&quot; 

You feel... wonderful, and full. It&#39;s hard to explain, but you feel the weight of the food inside you, without feeling like there&#39;s something with mass inside you? You grin up at Mammy Vi. &quot;Vi, this device in my hands, is actually recording us. There&#39;s a tiny camera.&quot; 

&quot;Ohh silly chile, cameras are much bigger than that-- my stars!&quot; Mammy Vi says when you show her her own face, in real-time. &quot;That&#39;s... me! How did you...&quot; 

&quot;This is Mammy Vi, guys!&quot; you say as you get to your feet and assume a selfie position. &quot;Say hello to everyone, they&#39;re going to love meeting you.&quot; 

&quot;I... gracious sakes. Hello?&quot; Mammy Vi looks awestruck. &quot;I don&#39;t understand, but. Who knows what you boys and your toys can do these days.&quot; 

You open your mouth to say something, but a mighty **BELCH** erupts from your gut. Oof, you... maybe overdid it on the ghostly cuisine, no? There&#39;s some gurglings and rumblings down there. Hopefully you didn&#39;t make yourself sick... 

Your body shudders and your hips jerk and as you look down at yourself, you see [[your abdomen suddenly bloat outwards-&gt;Y-Food Event 3]] and your eyes pop wide. You stare up at Mammy Vi. </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="24" name="Y-Food Event 3" tags="mammy" position="96,36" size="100,100">Your belly is rumbling and growling, as if you were hungry, but it&#39;s not... that&#39;s not right?? You feel, just, overwhelmingly full now, and you&#39;re actually getting bloated! Your pants have gone all tight and you definitely //look// like you ate all that food. 

&quot;Whoa...&quot; you whisper, aiming the camera down at yourself. &quot;Are you guys, uhhh. Seeing this?&quot; 

Mammy Vi reaches over and pats your gut. &quot;Now chile, you oughtta just go have a lie-down and digest, hmm?&quot; She gives you a loving, matronly smile. 

Under her hand, you shiver, and then your belly rumbles before plumping up //again,// even bigger... oh fuck. It&#39;s... it&#39;s like you&#39;re digesting in reverse or something... and RAPIDLY. Fuck. Fuck. You burp. You burp louder. FFuuuck. 

&quot;Uhh, right, I&#39;ll just... go find a spot... take a nice nap.&quot; You stagger away from her, out of the kitchen. 

&quot;You do that now.&quot; Mammy Vi beams at you as you leave. 

FUCK! You feel... horribly bloated. Fucking. Hell. Burping only seems to make it //worse.// Your skin&#39;s all tight, it almost feels like a drum... you rub your gut tenderly and waddle through the dining room. 

You could maybe just [[sit in one of these dining chairs,-&gt;Y-Food Event Chair]] and hope your stomach calms down soon. Catch your breath and reassemble your thoughts. How cool is it that you just met a ghost? 

Ugh. Maybe you should [[just keep moving.-&gt;Y-Food Event Move]] You feel like you&#39;re... carrying a bunch of extra weight in your gut, and if you sit down now, you might not get back up for awhile... </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="25" name="Y-Food Event Chair" tags="" position="25,156" size="100,100">Ugggh shit you just. You need to sit down. This is too much. You feel another belch rolling upwards and it bursts out of your mouth as you gently lower yourself onto an intact chair. It creaks underneath you. It&#39;s got a nice soft cushion at least. 

Your head swims. Sheesh, you&#39;re actually having some difficulty breathing-- it&#39;s not like you&#39;re choking, but ffffuck the pressure... you&#39;re almost panting. Your belly rumbles and boils and you cringe &quot;ohh nononono not again c&#39;mon--&quot; 

but no amount of protests are going to stop this ghostly... indigestion. Un-digestion? Un... death... digestion? 

You plump up further. Your gut is tight and swollen like a ripe melon. It&#39;s about the size of one, too. Crap. Crap! Your belt&#39;s all tight, but when you reach down to undo it... ffffuck where&#39;s your belt?? You whimper slightly as you dig under the tight skin of your stomach to find the buckle. Your fingers can barely touch it. 

OhnonononNONO you&#39;re about to bloat up again! You hurry and... **POP** shit, it almost feels like you&#39;ve exploded. Immediately you get some relief to the pressure as your belly surges forward and your belt rushes to get out of the way. You wave your hands; your fingers got kinda pinched there for a sec. 

Oof. You have. Well. Just. A great big round gut full of ghost food. That&#39;s just. That&#39;s nice. 

You yawn and [[start to doze off-&gt;Y-Food Event Chair 2]] with the chair creaking under you. </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="26" name="Y-Food Event Move" tags="" position="152,167" size="100,100">Clutching your full stomach carefully, you lumber out past the staircase and the foyer, into the living room. You might have gone searching for a bed upstairs, but just looking at the staircase is making you sweat. You feel so full that you&#39;re already panting, basically. 

Nah. Better to just. Pick one of these nice couches to relax upon. You can kick back and uhh... digest? Hopefully. 

&quot;Oooo,&quot; you moan quietly as you angle the camera down at your gut. &quot;This, you guys... uh. Yeah. This is. A ghost-food-baby. I guess. I didn&#39;t even think I ate that much? It tasted real, but like... mmf. **burp** Ooo. Oof. Mmm.&quot; You rub your gut as it gurgles, and then... 

Oh shit. 
It bloats up even bigger. You watch it swell up like a small balloon&#39;s being inflated inside. The button of your jeans pops open. 
&quot;Nnnggg... ffFUCK,&quot; you mumble. &quot;It keeps growing... help, guys??&quot; you sorta chuckle. You&#39;re embarrassed of course, but it&#39;s important that you keep recording. You want it all on camera: real-time, undeniable proof that you didn&#39;t make anything up. The views! The views. The subscribers. You try to keep them in mind as your fingers fumble for your belt, which is starting to cut into the underside of your gut. 

It&#39;s a chore, but you&#39;re able to get it undone, and then you just lay back with your head on the armrest of the couch, letting your eyelids droop. &quot;I guess, uhh, I&#39;m just gonna take a nap for now guys, and... **urp** ooof, try to recover...&quot; you laugh in spite of yourself. &quot;Don&#39;t ever eat ghost food, yeah?&quot; 

You reach over and pull the sheet off one of the chairs. It&#39;s a little dusty, but soft and clean. You cover yourself up with it, and then, you start to doze off. You&#39;re not quite asleep yet when you start to feel another bloat coming on; your belly rises up like a loaf of bread in an oven. It&#39;s packed tight and firm and warm and round. You&#39;re too sleepy by now to do anything but grin absently at it and let out a little giggle. Followed by a quiet belch. 

[[As you sleep...-&gt;Y-Food Event Move 2]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="27" name="Y-Food Event Chair 2" tags="end" position="18,288" size="100,100">You awake quite suddenly with a heavy THUMP and the sound of crackling wood. Startled and confused, you roll onto your back for a second, then sit up. You&#39;re... on the floor? 

and all around you is a... well, there&#39;s a chair leg there, and another chair leg right here, and... 

and a HUGE heavy ball-shaped belly sitting in front of you. Holy fuck, it&#39;s like you have a small child in there! You cringe at the sight of your body stretched out into such a massive globe. How are you gonna... move...? 

You look around for something to grab onto, and reach up to grip the edge of the dining table, and, well, you notice the tall windows. Through which bright sunlight is streaming through. 

Did you just sleep through the entire night?? Fuck, where&#39;s your phone... You reach down for your pocket, but your vast girth prevents you from reaching it. Dammit! You&#39;ll have to... stand up... you pull yourself to your feet, all wobbly and lumbering, and try to balance the weight of the massive gut hanging in front of your body. Sheesh, it&#39;s like, it&#39;s like the octo-fucking-mom. 

It&#39;s rumbling again. 
&quot;Oh no!&quot; you whimper. &quot;Nonono please don&#39;t!!&quot; 
Your belly groans and roils loudly before you, and you watch it stretch, and grow, bigger and bigger and tighter and oh fuck you&#39;re gonna pop!!

And you feel like a huge... pillow, suddenly slammed into you, knocking you back on the ground. You land with a //thump// and clunk your head against the wall. &quot;Ow!&quot; 

When the birds stop circling your head, you [[take a look at yourself-&gt;Y-Food End 1]]. 

Ahh, shit. </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="28" name="Y-Food End 1" tags="end" position="20,428" size="100,100">You&#39;re... you&#39;re fuckin&#39; FAT! 
You&#39;re gotten like. //Billowy!// You&#39;re like a damn marshmallow! You cringe and reach down and feel what USED to be a tightly-bloated drum of an abdomen, now soft and plump and squishy with fat. 

It&#39;s not just your belly that&#39;s round anymore... it&#39;s your whole damn body! You&#39;ve got a soft tubby keg in front of you, and your poor t-shirt&#39;s riding all the way up, revealing your padded back and love handles and fuck, you&#39;re just... spilling out of everything! Holy shit, your ass is just... 

Whining, you plod over to a floor length mirror you saw earlier in the hallway. Ok, so it&#39;s not... THAT bad, is it? You&#39;re not like, immobile. You&#39;ve just sort of... bloated up, all over. Lose about 10 pounds and people won&#39;t even have a right to call you obese. But fuck, dude, compared to the nice lean body you had before, //this//, this is just unnacceptable!! 

You can&#39;t button your pants back up, and you can&#39;t put your belt back on, so those just kinda hang loosely undone at your hips. Fuck, man, everything&#39;s all padded and chubby and... //juicy//. Shit! How are you gonna get rid of all this?? 

You don&#39;t even want to explore the rest of the plantation at this point, you just... wanna fuckin&#39; leave! 

You record an irritable vlog where you try to not show off too much of your newfound bulk, and then wait awhile for Beau to return. When you hear his airboat approaching the dock, you waddle as fast as you can down the path [[to the boathouse.-&gt;Y-Food End 2]] </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="29" name="Y-Food Event Move 2" tags="end" position="137,318" size="100,100">... you continue to grow. It happens in these same little spurts, just like when you were awake, and you can almost remember them? Perhaps a side effect of the ghost food keeps you slightly lucid despite being asleep? Who knows. No one else has ever eaten ghost food, have they? 

You just lay there peacefully dreaming, a placid smile spreading across your face every time you inflate some more. Your belly gets bigger and bigger. You almost look like another piece of sheet-draped furniture in the room, except you keep puffing up bigger and rounder like a ghostly balloon. 

And then, as the rays of sunlight stream into the living room through the fancy windows, your belly quivers and swells bigger... bigger, bigger still! With one last growth spurt... and then it all SHOOTS back into you, very suddenly, waking you up instantly. 

Blinking in the light, you sit up slowly, yawning, and reach for your phone. It&#39;s like, 7:00 AM? You slept through your entire ordeal... 

And then you look down at yourself and your eyes widen. 

[[Ohh SHIT.-&gt;Y-Food End 1]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="30" name="Y-Food End 2" tags="end" position="16,582" size="100,100">&quot;Oh hohoho! Hawhawhawhaw!!

&quot;Shut. Up.&quot; You grumble and fish for your wallet. &quot;Get me. Out. Of here.&quot; 

&quot;Hawhaw. Ha! Hahaha!&quot; Beau&#39;s laughter nearly drowns out the airboat&#39;s fan. &quot;I dunno, you might just sink mah boat hear, smol fren. Well uh. Guess you ain&#39;t mah &#39;smol&#39; fren, anymore, hahahaha!!&quot; 

**END** 

Uh-oh, you&#39;ve been fattened up significantly! Most of your clothes don&#39;t fit proper anymore, if at all, and... there&#39;s just really no hiding what&#39;s happened to you. And you&#39;ve been hyping up this trip for a long time now, so you can&#39;t just blank out on all your subscribers. You have to make an appearance, and everyone&#39;s got questions, and you do your best to explain why you&#39;ve, ahem. Increased in presence so dramatically. 

Some of your subscribers tease you in the comments, and some jump to your defense, but mostly everyone&#39;s just curious. And... actually the blow to your ego is soothed somewhat by the amount of people commenting just how THICC you are now and apparently there&#39;s a good amount of followers who find you rather more attractive at a heftier weight. Sssooo... ok? 

It&#39;s not a total loss of course. You&#39;ve got footage of an actual ghost, you&#39;ve got proof they exist (you really can&#39;t fake gaining that much weight in a single night), and soon you&#39;re raking in both viewcount money AND some interview money as various TV shows bring you on to have some chats.

Unfortunately if you wanna lose all this extra weight, it&#39;s... gonna take awhile. But you can definitely afford a trainer and some healthy food, at least! Hopefully &quot;ghost fat&quot; burns off quicker than regular fat... </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="31" name="N-Food Event Bad 1" tags="mammy" position="267,307" size="100,100">You quickly maneuver to put the large kitchen island between you and Mammy Vi. It&#39;s pretty long, and it&#39;ll give you time to think about your next move while she-- 

passes right through it because she&#39;s a ghost. 

&quot;Ahh crap,&quot; you mutter as you back away, and hit a wall. 

&quot;Mmm, c&#39;mon now chile, you can&#39;t expect to get big &#39;n strong if you don&#39;t eat a proper good meal, nah!&quot; Mammy brings the overfilled pastry up to your face. 

You turn your head away, and cringe sideways, and manage not to get it shoved into your mouth. So Mammy tuts, and quickly shoves it 

//directly. into. your. gut.// Her entire hand passes through your body and comes out minus one fattening-looking piece of dessert. You clap a hand to your mouth as a massive hiccup-belch hybrid erupts from deep inside you, and then your entire body twitches as you feel a sudden heavy weight blossom in your tummy. 

&quot;Damn,&quot; you flinch as you look down. You&#39;re. VERY full now. Your hands clutch at your abdomen by instinct; the ghostly food is packed in there tight and firm. You even //look// a little bloated. 

Mammy Vi giggles and holds up, holy shit, another... eclair-lookin&#39; thing. &quot;Remember sir, we&#39;ve got to keep up appearances. No one&#39;s gonna take you seriously as an entrepeneur if you&#39;re just skin n&#39; bones, chile.&quot; 

The fuck is she talking about?? Nevermind that, you&#39;ve gotta get outta here or she&#39;s going to keep loading you like she&#39;s filling a pie! 

There&#39;s a sack of flour off to the right. You could [[throw it at her-&gt;N-Food Event Bad 2]] in the hopes it&#39;ll distract her. 

Dude just run! She&#39;s a ghost, you&#39;ll pass right through her.

... well, you&#39;ve dodged her momentarily, but fuck if you haven&#39;t somehow managed to sexually arouse a ghost who might be well over 200 years old. What do you want to do next? 

[[Shit, dude. Do it again!-&gt;N-Food Event Good 2]] 

[[She&#39;s distracted, head for the door!-&gt;N-Food Event Bad 3]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="33" name="N-Food Event Good 2" tags="mammy" position="468,479" size="100,100">Shit, shit shit. 

You&#39;re gonna //sexually harass this ghost// aren&#39;t you? 
Well it&#39;s either that, or... get stuffed to the gills! Anyway, she seems to like it; you almost feel a shred of pity for her having likely gone many, many years without any pleasure whatsoever... 

So you slide sideways around her pastry-loaded hand, and slip right through her body. It feels kinda like walking through a cloud of cool mist. 

&quot;HOOOO YESS-SIR I DO DECLARE,&quot; Mammy Vi hollers, and you see the pastry has disappeared from her hand and she&#39;s rubbing her big soft titties. &quot;Ohh, lil chile you better do that again now, y&#39;hear? Don&#39;tchu leave me hangin&#39; like this now chile. Lawd have mercy!&quot; 

You watch her carefully for just a second to make sure it&#39;s not, you know, a trick to lure you in and force-feed you anything else. Exhilirated, you leap forwards and slip a little on the crumbled cookware underfoot, but it&#39;s ok because you slide smoothly through her like you actually //meant// to pull a //Risky Business// and Mammy Vi lets out a sharp squeal. 

&quot;YES CHILD YES. Oooo swing LOW sweet baby, mm-hmm!&quot; Mammy hunches over the kitchen island with her voluminous rear end out, back arched in. &quot;Ohhh, the fire in my LOINS,&quot; she starts to sing and wiggle her ass for you. &quot;Ohh, the fire/ Fire in my loins/ Bakin&#39; up a pair of buns/ For my darlin&#39; Johny boy/ ohh my Johnny/ stokin&#39; up my fire/ With his sturdy LOOOGGG...&quot; 

She&#39;s got a nice voice, but... 
Yeah you&#39;re gettin&#39; [[the FUCK outta here-&gt;Mammy GTFO]]. While she&#39;s distracted. Hopefully she won&#39;t see you leave, or is tethered to the kitchen or something... </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="34" name="N-Food Event Bad 3" tags="mammy" position="159,590" size="100,100">You keep her devil&#39;s foodcake hand as far away from you as possible as you sprint for the door. It&#39;s wide open, and there&#39;s the dining room, and... 

And you hit a wall?? No! Nonono there&#39;s... it&#39;s... what the fuck?!? You can clearly see the dining room, just ahead of you, but... there&#39;s a totally solid wall right in front of you that you can&#39;t even pass through! 

... Mammy Vi came through a different wall earlier, didn&#39;t she? No wait, it was that locked door over there-- was this set of double-doors not built until after she died or something?? That&#39;s the only explanation-- 

It&#39;s too late to ponder this surreal turn of events, as you feel Mammy Vi reach into your back and deposit a BIG pastry into your lower belly. 

&quot;Urrgghh...&quot; you grunt and double over, clutching at yourself. &quot;No-no, wait... stop! **BUUURRRP**&quot; and you tilt backwards, into her arms, as your belly begins to swell before you. &quot;Ohh fffuck,&quot; you choke out. Your breathing is labored with the pressure growing inside you, compressing your lungs above. You look like you swallowed a basketball or something. 

Somehow Mammy Vi is... holding you. On either side of your face, you can see her massive, apron-clad bosoms depressed like soft pillows. &quot;Don&#39;t worry chile. I gotcha. I&#39;ve made you such a good meal you might not even be able to move once you&#39;re done eatin&#39;!&quot; And she lets out a lovely, hearty laugh as though she&#39;s doing you a favor and you should be grateful... 

[[and then she drags you backwards...-&gt;N-Food Event End]] </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="35" name="N-Food Event Bad 2" tags="mammy" position="164,463" size="100,100">You make a break for the sack of flour sitting on the counter nearby and toss it at Mammy Vi, who&#39;s hot on your heels. It billows out in a great cloud of white. &quot;Hooo chile you makin&#39; a MESS up in my kitchen nah! You stop that! You stop that right nah &#39;fore I go out and cut me a switch!&quot; 

It&#39;s hard to actually SEE her now that there&#39;s a misty white flour-fog everywhere, and she&#39;s closer than you&#39;d hoped, because one of her hands swings right through your midriff... and you groan as you realize it had a pastry in it. You cover your mouth as you back away from the flour cloud. A roiling belch still bubbles up from your gut as you shiver and watch your belly puff up like a beach ball being inflated. 

Mammy&#39;s right. Fuckin&#39; there. Too. Oh shit. She&#39;s a lot, umm. Whiter, now. 

You jump as she spazzes out horrifically and for just a tiny spark of time, appears as a terrifying, jagged-toothed, gaunt-faced version of herself. And then the sweet, matronly visage is back. 

She&#39;s got you cornered, and you can&#39;t quite see where the door is. You&#39;ve smoke-screened yourself. What do you do? 

Well running and &quot;fighting back&quot; isn&#39;t exactly working, is it? Maybe you could [[try to trick her-&gt;N-Food Event 5]] by playing along with her, uhh. Time period. 

What if you... [[grabbed her ass?-&gt;N-Food Event Good 1.5]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="36" name="N-Food Event End" tags="mammy badend" position="162,711" size="100,100">Somehow Mammy Vi is able to LIFT you over her shoulder like a sack of potatoes, only for a moment, and plunk your ass down in a chair by the kitchen&#39;s bay window. &quot;Now you just sit tight sweet thang. A little gin and tonic will help with your digestion and make sure you have plenty o&#39; room for all the vittles you can fit.&quot; 

And with that, she turns and floats towards the far wall-- and then disappears, reappearing at the bare wall and miming opening a door. Your theory seems about right, there had to have been some reconstruction at some point. The door to the kitchen must&#39;ve been over there during her lifetime... and then it was filled in and a new door was carved out of the wall here, for easier access to the dining room... Not that this revelation helps you now. And how the fuck does a ghost&#39;s presence switch the fucking physics of reality-- //dammit// your head hurts. 

&quot;Ohh shit,&quot; you rasp out, cringing, cradling your swollen tummy. You wince as you try to sit up; the chair creaks loudly beneath you. You... you&#39;ve got to get up! And you&#39;ve got to record, as well! You don&#39;t want to show the Internet your, um, embarrassingly round belly, but... it&#39;s important that your subscribers realize what happened to you, even though you&#39;d rather NO one find out about this. 

So you pull out your phone-- a chore, given the way your jeans are a good deal tighter. You start recording, awkwardly fiddling with your belt one-handed. &quot;Ugghh... ffffFUCK you guys, this... this ghost lady, she&#39;s like, uhh. I think she was a slave cook? **BURP** Oof, she&#39;s like... she can cram food in my mouth or like, //literally// straight into my stomach, like right through me, &#39;cuz she&#39;s a ghost, and...&quot; 

&quot;Here we go, sweet chile,&quot; Mammy Vi says-- she&#39;s suddenly RIGHT next to you, even though a split second before, she was across the room in the &#39;doorway.&#39; She&#39;s got a big jug in her hands. 

&quot;Nonono wait!!&quot; you yelp and scramble to get up. 

[[But you can&#39;t.-&gt;N-Food Event End 2]] </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="37" name="N-Food Event 5" tags="mammy" position="350,466" size="100,100">&quot;Uhh, ok look, uhh... just hold on a second now, Mammy Vi,&quot; you say, holding your hands up. She&#39;s still approaching. Better think fast! 

&quot;Uhh, uhh..! If you, I mean, if I eat too much, uhh, I mean I&#39;ve got to head off to the marketplace soon, you know? And I don&#39;t want to, uhh...&quot; you rub your full belly for effect. &quot;Cause my poor horse any back pains, right?&quot; 

Mammy Vi stops and blinks at you a few times, frowning as if deep in thought. &quot;I... hmm. Yes, uh... That is a lovely animal you&#39;ve got... and I certainly wouldn&#39;t want to make you too heavy to ride her!&quot; Her pleasant smile reappears. &quot;But you DO need to at least have a light breakfast for now, it ain&#39;t right to skip the most important meal of the day.&quot; 

&quot;Uhh... ok, just.&quot; You cringe, but prepare yourself. &quot;Just a few bites, ok? But I really do need to be going.&quot; Ok. Ok. It&#39;s working, it&#39;s working, you&#39;ll just... placate her, and then be off, hopefully before your jeans pop open. 

Mammy watches happily as you accept the... it&#39;s some sort of tart? From her hand. Oh, it&#39;s like a quiche or something... you pop the misty piece of food into your mouth and mime chewing. You can definitely taste it, nice and cheesy and eggy, you just can&#39;t really... feel it. 

But it lands in your gut just the same and makes you **URP** and your stomach plumps up accordingly. You flinch as you feel it stretch and bulge outwards. You look, and feel, like you&#39;ve just finished third helpings at Thanksgiving Dinner. 

&quot;Ok then, well... **urp** I&#39;ll be going then, uhh, lots of... groceries and supplies to //purchase,// as you know,&quot; you say, trying to sound like a proper gentleman. &quot;Uhh, thank you very much Mammy Vi. **Burp!**&quot; 

&quot;Heaven sakes, sweetie, not even a word,&quot; she cooes and waves a hand at you. &quot;Go on now, be off with yourself, outta my way so I can clean up this here mess. Be safe now!&quot; 

She... vanishes. 
Unfortunately her ghostly cooking does not. Your belly is firm and round and pressing tight against your pants and belt. But... crisis avoided? Hopefully. 

You [[hurry out of the kitchen.-&gt;Stuffed by Mammy Vi]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="38" name="N-Food Event Good 1.5" tags="mammy" position="284,597" size="100,100">&quot;Oof!&quot; Mammy stops dead in her tracks. &quot;Ooohoo hoo hoo. Chile, chile. Gracious sakes. I... I don&#39;t know what to... heheheh. Don&#39;t be gettin&#39; fresh up in my kitchen nah!&quot; she covers her mouth slightly with a hand to hide her coy little grin. 

Well great. That&#39;s probably the first action she&#39;s experienced in some 200 years or so. Possibly more; there&#39;s a... certain stretch of history she might have been alive in, and you&#39;re not quite sure. You don&#39;t just want to assume &#39;Civil War Era,&#39; but that&#39;s a good guess. Point is... what do you do now that you&#39;ve gotten a centuries-old chubby-chasing ghost horny? 

[[Run while she&#39;s flustered!-&gt;N-Food Event Bad 4]]

[[Do it again, bitch!-&gt;N-Food Event Good 2]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="39" name="N-Food Event Bad 4" tags="mammy" position="291,716" size="100,100">&quot;Ooo honey chile.&quot; Mammy shudders. &quot;You keep that up and...&quot; 

You&#39;ve already stopped listening to her, and sprint for the doorway to the dining room. 

... you&#39;re not entirely sure what happens next, as you black out for a few moments. When you come to your senses, there&#39;s a dull throbbing in your skull and you&#39;re flat on your back. 

What the //fuck//? Did you just... hit a solid wall? But no, there&#39;s nothing... it&#39;s just a pair of old doors, hanging open! How the... 

Mammy tuts above you with folded arms. She&#39;s upside down. &quot;Now that&#39;s just the most damn fool thing I ever did see. Why would you go and run into a wall like that? You be gettin&#39; in the moonshine cupboard again?&quot; 

&quot;... wha--??&quot; is all you can manage. You&#39;re stunned. Like, in the mental sense of &#39;there&#39;s not a wall there but I ran into one anyway,&#39; and also in the physical sense, like an RPG status effect. Can&#39;t even take your turn! 

Mammy Vi shakes her head. &quot;Well, if you&#39;re done gettin&#39; me all hot &#39;n bothered before tryin&#39; to leave me high &#39;n dry, I&#39;ve still got a job to do, and that&#39;s gettin&#39; you fed up proper good, understand?&quot; 

She reaches for you, and... [[lifts you up into the air.-&gt;N-Food Event End]] </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="40" name="Foyer Reflection" tags="inspect" position="1509,190" size="100,100">You give your reflection a brave, winning smile. You look good for the camera. You can&#39;t comment much on your own attractiveness, as it&#39;s really not your opinion that matters, is it? You assume that if you were ugly, you&#39;d not be a very popular content creator. 

You&#39;re fairly average in build, for a young 20-something. Not particularly large or beefy, but strong enough to go about your daily business and open stubborn containers. You&#39;ve got a decently built chest, nothing overly impressive but not too shabby, and while you don&#39;t have a six-pack, you&#39;re flat-bellied and firm. 

You&#39;re wearing a comfy, thin t-shirt and a pair of well-worn, much-loved jeans with your favorite belt. You have a lanyard with your car keys attached. Your wallet is in your pocket. Your phone is usually in your other pocket when you&#39;re not using it to record. You love traveling light and not feeling weighted down by additional responsibilities of carrying expensive recording equipment, though someday in the future as your channel grows, you&#39;ll likely have to. 

[[Enough admiring yourself, though-&gt;Enter Foyer]]. </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="41" name="N-Food Event End 2" tags="mammy badend" position="39,707" size="100,100">You cry out as you watch Mammy shove the mouth of the jug into your gut. You can almost //feel// your bellybutton opening around it like a small mouth, and you wanna puke; it&#39;s sick. You cringe and twitch around in the chair as you feel the bubbling cold liquid pour into you. Glug, glug, glug, glug. Your abdomen squirms and bubbles with it like there&#39;s something alive in there, kicking around. You can feel your skin stretching as you swell slightly bigger, and let out a few wet-sounding **BELCH**es. 

Somehow, you keep recording dutifully. You have to. It&#39;s... it&#39;s the only thing that&#39;s gonna save you now, isn&#39;t it? Oh fuck. Fuck shit shit fuck. She&#39;s gonna... she&#39;s gonna pack you. Absolutely full. 

Mammy Vi removes the jug, which disappears into thin air, and suddenly she&#39;s got a great big phantom cream pie in her hands. She smiles sweetly down at you as she lifts a piece of it on a serving knife. &quot;Open wiiiiide...&quot; 

&quot;Nonono please,&quot; you beg, but she&#39;s beyond hearing you. 

She shoves the piece of pie right into your gut. You feel it land like a punch. Your eyes go wide. Holy crap, it&#39;s heavy. There is a terrible little small moment where you see that malevolent presence sneering out of Mammy Vi&#39;s normally beatific, plump, maternal face. It&#39;s like a hidden devil. Then she&#39;s smiling again, and readying to shove another piece of pie into you. 

Each time she does, your abdomen accepts it, and greedily grows to accomodate more, and more. You feel horrifically overstuffed after just the first slice, and they keep coming. You are ballooning immensely. A small &#39;pop&#39; at your crotch signifies your jeans coming undone; you&#39;re glad you had the foresight to undo your belt, because that would&#39;ve been a lot of pain you wouldn&#39;t have been able to relieve otherwise. 

Another slice of pie enters you, [[and your entire body starts to quiver involuntarily-&gt;N-Food Event Bad End]]. </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="42" name="N-Food Event Bad End" tags="mammy badend" position="33,838" size="100,100">As your avaricious abdomen engulfs Mammy&#39;s entire hand, it shakes and quakes like it&#39;s afraid of something, and that tremor runs throughout your entire body, up and down each limb, until there&#39;s a nasty //GLORP//ing noise and you watch in relief as your abdomen&#39;s tight round shape starts to shrink. Good, good, you&#39;re digesting... 

Except immediately after, the tight bloated feeling wells up in the REST of you, and every inch of you... grows an inch or so. 

//Mammy is fattening you up!!// You watch your fingers swell like you&#39;re retaining water, like, fuck, like an OLD motherfucker who&#39;s got too much sodium in their diet! Your wristbones disappear, you look down and see your slim pectorals getting puffy and rounded, your previously-ball-shaped abdomen growing more... weighty, but still round. You feel your clothes stretch and tighten around you. Soft pads and rolls form on your back and at your sides. Your ass thickens. 

You choke out a sob. You nearly drop your phone. &quot;Please!! Please stop!&quot; and you make one last desperate attempt to stand, now that you&#39;re at least not feeling so much pressure in your gut. 

&quot;Whatchu doin&#39; honey chile, you still got plenty &#39;o pie left here!&quot; Mammy says as her round arm swings lightning quick to shove another slice right into your belly. 

You slam back into the chair and hear a tiny little crack, and whimper as you watch and feel your gut bloating again, bigger than ever! 

Above you, Mammy Vi smiles, and readies yet [[another slice of pie.-&gt;N-Food Event Bad End 2]] </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="43" name="N-Food Event Bad End 2" tags="mammy badend" position="162,837" size="100,100">**END** 

You bulge and billow and grow, larger, heavier, softer, thicker. The chair snaps to pieces underneath you. At some point you drop your phone, but it keeps recording the audio of your body engorging, being filled, being fattened. And your voice. Your pleading, begging, terrified voice. 

Soon you are a vast round... person of greater heft, shall we say. You pass out, and when you wake up, Mammy is gone and the golden sunlight of the next morning is warming your bare flesh. Your shirt is a tiny tube top sitting pretty over your bulging soft pecs. Your feet look far too small to be at the end of your gigantic legs, let alone capable of holding up your massive new body. 

Somehow you&#39;re able to stand by pulling yourself up using the kitchen counter. Your pants are an utter mess, laying on the floor in shreds. Your boxers are now... briefs. Barely. You almost can&#39;t even pick your phone up off the ground. The battery&#39;s nearly dead and it&#39;s been recording this entire time. That&#39;s gonna take some editing. 

You waddle out of the house and plod like a dinosaur down the path to the boathouse, where you wait for a few hours, trying to process the events of the night. Soon you hear the sound of the airboat fan approaching, and when Beau sees you, he laughs for a solid 2 minutes straight. &quot;Well my not-smol fren, I can see RIGHT clearly that I&#39;m gonna need a much bigger boat nah, your chunkyass gonna sink this one, haw haw haw!&quot; 

Long story short, you have to wait MUCH longer for him to return with a larger boat capable of transporting you back across. You can barely fit into your car and it DEFINITELY sinks down on the driver&#39;s side under your immense weight. 

... well, you have proof of ghosts now! So there&#39;s that. Hopefully the subscriber money you make from your video, and any... ghost-interested parties with cash to blow... will enable you to afford a good fuckin&#39; personal trainer. &#39;Cuz you&#39;ve got a LONG road ahead of you if you ever wanna be light and slim again. </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="44" name="Mammy GTFO" tags="mammy" position="494,599" size="100,100">Shit. Well that worked somehow, didn&#39;t it. You trot away from the kitchen, out into the dining room... there&#39;s some weird flickerings of what you can only assume is time or space, as you see flashes of pale ghostliness poof in and out of existence on your way out. Must be Mammy Vi affecting the area around her with her, erm... stimulations. 

Well, what now? You&#39;re standing in the hallway, and the Foyer where you came in is just off to your right... across the way is the threshold that leads into the Living room. You turn and take a look down towards the other end of the house. 

Why the fuck is there a door open down that way? You start to walk towards it. Sure, it&#39;s an old house, but you don&#39;t want... who knows. A fucking alligator to crawl up out the bayou and get curious about the big building, and... well, you&#39;re worrying about shit that&#39;ll never happen, but you were NOT raised in a barn, and feel like you should [[go shut it-&gt;Backdoor Beau]]. 

Of course you don&#39;t //have// to, that&#39;s just your upbringing, and you can always fight your parent&#39;s programming and head [[upstairs to explore-&gt;Upstairs Landing]] or maybe even get some rest. </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="45" name="Stuffed by Mammy Vi" tags="mammy" position="416,801" size="100,100">Well THAT could&#39;ve been worse. You may be fairly stuffed, but who knows how much MORE she would have tried to pack into you? You&#39;re still, well. Mobile. You loosen your belt up to get some relief from the pressure, and give your firm round gut a few rubs. **burp** When you pat it, it kinda... bounces? And when you give it a light //smack!// it almost sounds like a drum, or a volleyball... shit, dude. 
You can see your reflection in that one mirror in the foyer, and you turn to view a few angles of yourself. 

Fuck are you ever //bloated// though! 
You&#39;re big enough to where it&#39;s plainly visible, even from a distance, that you&#39;ve got full and rounded gut. Your shirt can&#39;t hide it, and even rides up just a bit-- and it goes higher if you raise your arms. Basically you don&#39;t feel as full as you look, but you look DAMN full regardless. You half expect your bellybutton to be all... pokin&#39; out, like a pregnant chick. Ok, you&#39;re not //that// big but still. 

You pull your phone out, take a couple pics, and film a few seconds of video, showing off your swollen belly. &quot;So this, you guys... fuck, it&#39;s embarrassing and I DON&#39;T wanna show y&#39;all, but, this is what happens when you let a ghost feed you apparently. So yeah. **belch** Don&#39;t do that.&quot; Gotta have content to provide, right? You try to keep it light, play cool, like it&#39;s no big deal. **burp** it is, though. A big deal. Shit. 

So now what? You&#39;re definitely not going back in the kitchen again, and you... ugggh, your poor bulging gut gives a rumble and then... //grows a little bigger.// Blech. It&#39;s all tight n&#39; gross like a fat fucker! Looks like someone forced a watermelon down your throat or something. Ew. 

Well, what&#39;s your plan? There&#39;s still the rest of the house to explore, though no one would blame you if you said &#39;well that&#39;s enough ghostly activity for one night I&#39;m gonna go to bed.&#39; You could just, [[head on upstairs-&gt;Plod on Up]] and find yourself a place to sleep. That&#39;d be nice... except you have to climb stairs with this fuckin&#39; gut. 

Shit, maybe you could just crash in the [[Living Room, though-&gt;LR while Rounded]]. Quicker and easier-- and Mammy hasn&#39;t followed you, so you should be safe from her, right? She must only haunt the kitchen or something. 

Hey wait... way down at the end of the hall, past the stairs. Is that... is that an open door, [[leading outside?-&gt;Check Back Door]] </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="46" name="Run Hall RG Start" tags="" position="1436,458" size="100,100">You turn and sprint back towards the front door. 

At the last second you realize that if you OPEN the door, that thing back there will 100% see the motion and come running for you. 

The stairs going up are not an option either-- you need to be fast AND quiet, and it&#39;s hard enough doing that on this old hardwood flooring, let alone that &#39;definitely-creaky-as-fuck&#39; staircase. 

You can either turn right and head into the [[kitchen,-&gt;SneakDiningRoom]]... 

or, you can turn left, and try hiding in the [[living room.-&gt;Stealth Living Room]] 

</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="47" name="Hall RG Hide" tags="RG" position="1300,596" size="100,100">You swing around the corner and crouch as low as you can without losing your balance, as you tiptoe carefully down the old stairs. You try to hold your breath so you don&#39;t hyperventilate and give your position away. And you back up. 

Or rather, back down. 

Down the stairs. 

Step. 
	By. 
		Step. 
			Slowly. 
				Down. 
					Quietly. 
						Into. 
							The shadows. 
								Of the basement. 

At the bottom of the stairs, you can&#39;t see it coming any more. You glance down at yourself, completely engulfed in shadow. You should be basically invisible, right now. Unless it has night vision. 

You hear the thumps of its huge feet, its heavy body making the house creak and groan. You steady your breathing. The footsteps are right beside the down staircase. 

Right above you. 

And they pass. 

Sweet fucking hell&#39;s bells. You&#39;re safe. You hold still for a few minutes longer until you don&#39;t hear any more heavy footsteps. It feels like an hour, but once you&#39;re sure the beast has moved on, you breath deep and easy, and turn to [[inspect your surroundings.-&gt;The Basement]] </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="48" name="Bedtime" tags="false" position="1167,452" size="100,100">So guess what. 

You picked the boring fucking choice. 

You picked a nice, soft-looking old bed in a room that didn&#39;t smell too bad, and slept soundly all night and not even one fucking ghostly ORB made an appearance, let alone any crazy, poltergeist-y shenanigans. 

Like bruh. What kinda ghost hunter are you anyway? This isn&#39;t what your fans are gonna be happy to see. 
Shit. You&#39;re gonna have to stay an extra night, aren&#39;t you. Yep. Yep. You sure are. If you expect to please your subscribers, you are. And your motherfuckin&#39; phone&#39;s out of battery now! 

You sigh, and leave the house, and head on down to the boathouse. The radio takes you a minute to figure out, but you put out a few calls for Beau. He picks up after a half hour of silence. You arrange for him to bring you some light snack foods-- stuff you don&#39;t need to heat up. And a cheap power bank to recharge your phone. Gonna be an extra chunk of money lost unfortunately, but that&#39;s the price you pay for idleness. 

Once Beau brings your stuff and you&#39;ve made arrangements for him to pick you up tomorrow, you bid him goodbye and he speeds off back into the swamp. You put your food safely in the bedroom you slept in, and head outside to get some pictures and video of the estate. There&#39;s beautiful overgrown gardens and statuary, an old fountain, some... small shacks and outbuildings... 

You eat, and explore, but soon evening&#39;s upon you. It couldn&#39;t have come quickly enough. Time to get back to work! There was just enough charge in your new power bank to fill your phone back up to the top, so you REALLY gotta find something cool tonight. 

So once more, starting from the first floor: 

You can see what&#39;s happening in the [[Dining Room]] late at night. 

You can head into the [[Living Room Earlier]], where the sheet-draped furniture almost resembles old-school ghosts in its own right. 

Or you can creep down the main [[Hallway]] past the stairs, where commissioned portraits of the original residents seem to be hanging. </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="49" name="The Basement" tags="basement" position="1300,726" size="100,100">You&#39;re in a basement. It&#39;s... rather much like any other basement you&#39;ve ever seen. Very unfinished, cold, stony. Almost like a tomb. 

And there are spiderwebs EVERYWHERE. On every single thing you can see. Sheesh, no one&#39;s cleaned down here for... possibly hundreds of years, eh? Who knows how long it&#39;s been since anyone lived here? Maybe you&#39;ll find out tonight. Maybe the previous owners have left some clues behind. Wouldn&#39;t that be something, if you found... some kid&#39;s missing Game Boy cartridge or something down here? 

It occurs to you that a basement, in an old antebellum plantation, //in the middle of a bayou in Louisiana,// seems very much out-of-place. In fact, it seems impossible. How&#39;d they manage this? You&#39;ve done your homework; the flooding around here gets so bad they build a lot of houses on stilts ten feet off the ground or higher. The cemeteries out here are built ABOVE the ground, or at least, in raised stone coffins. 

What madman built this place, and more importantly, //how//? 

You&#39;ve got to have a look around. You head deeper into the basement, sliding your phone&#39;s flashlight on and shining it all over the webby, dusty basement. It&#39;s actually incredible. What sort of... 

Did something just //move// over there in the darkness?? 

You [[slowly aim your phone&#39;s flashlight over there...-&gt;Huge Spider]] by the stairs you just came down. </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="50" name="Huge Spider" tags="HS" position="1303,867" size="100,100">Your body prickles with instant goosebumps and your eyes widen in horror. 

Crawling up the wall, and turning upside down on the ceiling, is an arachnid the size of a fucking **HORSE.** 

You just jumped from the frying pan into the motherfuckin&#39; fire. 

The chittering noise coming from its pedipalps invokes a primal terror in you. You aren&#39;t sure if you ever would have described yourself as arachnophobic before, but you damn sure are now, if only because THE BITCH AIN&#39;T SUPPOSED TO BE THAT DAMNED BIG!!!

You can&#39;t even think of what... spider species it might be. It&#39;s kinda hairy, a dull gray color, ohh fuck it has these huge black eyes, and they&#39;re just... staring at you. Like it&#39;s surprised to see you or something. 

Your breathing is no longer under control and you are starting to quietly hyperventilate because you want to scream but you know screaming would be a TERRIBLE idea and yet you&#39;re building up to one and if you don&#39;t do something you&#39;re GOING TO SCREAM-- 

The massive arthropod starts to thump across the ceiling towards you. Confidently. 

[[Run for the stairs.-&gt;NOPE]] 

[[Run to the corner of the room.-&gt;ALSO NOPE]] </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="51" name="NOPE" tags="HS" position="1172,813" size="100,100">You face the dubiously insurmountable task of keeping as MUCH distance between you and the monstrous spider as possible... and yet, getting to the stairs. Which are rather much closer to the spider than to you. But you have got to try. If you run deeper into this basement, you might not find your way back out-- you saw some doors and corridors suggesting it&#39;s a lot bigger down here than it has any right to be. 

//Maybe the SPIDER built this place?// But then who the fuck... built the stairs??!? 

You hear its feet thumping behind you, and then a BIGGER thump, and you reach the stairs and you&#39;re free-- 

NO NO NO NO NO IT HAS YOUR FOOT, you fall forward and break the fall with your hands, and you scream and grab one of the steps, and the spider jerks you backwards. 

You&#39;re fighting it now, directly. 

[[Kick it with your free foot!!!-&gt;MORE NOPE]] 

[[Go for its eyes!!-&gt;SO MUCH NOPE]] </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="52" name="ALSO NOPE" tags="HS" position="1432,800" size="100,100">You sprint away from the stairs, away from... light, and hope, and a place that isn&#39;t a DANK ASS SPIDERY ASS INFESTED ASS BASEMENT. The floor is soft and webby under your feet... you hope you don&#39;t find yourself stuck like a fly. Doesn&#39;t webbing go... &#39;inert&#39; after awhile? Lose its stickiness or whatever? 

There are rough tunnels in the walls, like... they don&#39;t look man-made. You&#39;re not fucking going in there. 

The light from your phone swings all over the place as you keep running. The spider&#39;s hot on your heels. It&#39;s going to jump down and slam you on the ground and bite and kill-- 

You turn aside and hear a SMACK. As you run away from the corner, you can see the spider on the ground, having slammed itself into the wall and desperately trying to right itself. The long legs kick frantically; they&#39;re each as long as you are tall, easy. 

It must have a hard time slowing its momentum. Could you... in lieu of proper weaponry, maybe defeat it by making it charge into walls? [[It might be worth a shot.-&gt;BITCH NOPE]] 

But the stairs are wide open! You can make that distance before it catches you, right?? [[What have you got to lose?!?-&gt;NOPITY NOPE NOPE]] </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="53" name="MORE NOPE" tags="HS" position="1049,862" size="100,100">Panicking and terrified, you lash out with your other foot. You slam the spider upside the face, and it hisses at you. You wind up to do it again; it&#39;s the only weapon you&#39;ve got-- 

The spider nips your foot and you shriek in pain. 

[[The bite doesn&#39;t paralyze you-&gt;FUCKING NOPE]], but holy fuck does it hurt for a few seconds. And now the spider&#39;s got a good opening through your defenses... </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="54" name="SO MUCH NOPE" tags="HS" position="1053,1001" size="100,100">The last thing you want to do is touch the big hairy fucker but you&#39;ve gotta, your life probably depends on it now. You summon all your courage and bend down to strike the spider in one of its big ugly black eyes. You curl your fingers into claws as you swing, hoping to cause some damage with your nails-- 

FUCK FUCK FUCK it lets go of your foot but grabs your hand and yanks you upwards and you drop back down on your side hard, and before you can scramble up, you hear a nasty //squirting// noise... 

[[Your foot&#39;s webbed to the ground!!-&gt;FUCKING NOPE]] </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="55" name="FUCKING NOPE" tags="HS" position="1188,977" size="100,100">You blink a few pained, frantic tears from your eyes and try to pull away, but the spider&#39;s got your foot webbed down, and before you can attempt to free yourself, there&#39;s a SPLAT of web as it doubles itself forward and webs your other foot. 

You quiver with fear and cringe as the [[spider looms over you.-&gt;HOLY FUCKIN SHIT NOPE]]  </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="56" name="HOLY FUCKIN SHIT NOPE" tags="HS" position="1306,989" size="100,100">Your head spins and throbs from the pain of being beaten up by this abomination, and your heart pounds and you feel like the fear is going to make your chest burst open... 

The Huge Spider scuttles over you and then your feet feel a tug, and as you spin sideways, you realize it&#39;s DRAGGING YOU. There is no amount of machismo or bravado left in you that&#39;s capable of stopping you from whimpering in abject, pure, unadulterated fear. 

You&#39;re lifted up by your feet. The spider&#39;s climbing up to the ceiling with you in tow. There&#39;s so much webbing all around you. Suddenly you drop a few feet and let out a little scream, but you land on a thick pillowy strand of webbing. It&#39;s... not as sticky as you expect, not at all like the stuff holding your feet together. 

And suddenly your feet //aren&#39;t// being held together? You twist back and see that the spider&#39;s severing the web around your feet and pulling it away with its fangs... EATING its own web... well, apparently that&#39;s a thing. 

What the fuck does it want with you?? You&#39;re no expert on spiders but you at least know that their standard operating procedure tends to be &#39;web up, bite down, suck suck suck until empty.&#39; 

You&#39;re at least grateful to not be spider soup by now, but... how long&#39;s that going to last?? 
There&#39;s the ground below, just... four or five feet away. 
There&#39;s the stairs, just... over there. You could make it there in about three seconds. 

The spider crawls closer, on top of you, and you hear its fangs clicking above your head and neck and [[you brace yourself for the final pain-&gt;Spider Bad End]] you will ever feel in your life. </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="57" name="BITCH NOPE" tags="HS" position="1443,960" size="100,100">Heh. Shit, you might actually be able to put this fucker down! Or at least knock it out long enough to neutralize it as a threat. You bolt up to the opposite end of the basement, hearing the spider starting to thump along behind you. Fuck, it&#39;s... it&#39;s just so damn CREEPY, hearing those legs 
	thumpity	thumpity	thump	thumpity
thumpity	thumpity	thumpy

just... tapping the ground, rhythmic, relentless... but you&#39;ve got it this time. You&#39;ve figured this beast out. You reach the opposite wall, and you have just enough time to glance back and grin triumphantly, 

[[when the spider launches itself directly at you-&gt;HOLY FUCKIN SHIT NOPE]] and slams your body to the ground. </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="58" name="NOPITY NOPE NOPE" tags="HS" position="1563,900" size="100,100">Fuck that noise, the exit&#39;s clear and you are getting the FUCK outta here. You&#39;ll take your chances with Mr. Growly Beast upstairs; you know how spiders kill and eat their meals, it&#39;s a long and undignified death, for sure. 

Thank goodness you&#39;re in such good shape. You may not be an Olympian, but you FEEL like one, and you&#39;re sure you could&#39;ve competed with one, had someone been timing you just now. You almost don&#39;t even feel like you&#39;re climbing stairs at all. You just... shoot up them. You glance back down as you reach the top, and see the spider appear at the bottom, hissing, tapping at the walls as it begins to climb up towards you. 

You slam the door shut and lean against it. 
Fucking. NOPE. 

You&#39;re back on the first floor now, thank FUCK. Your chest heaves as you try to catch your breath and calm down. That. Was too fucking close. 

Is it over? Is that... other thing, the monster, Mr. Growly Beast... the &#39;Roo-ga-roo&#39; Beau mentioned. Is he still hanging around?? 

One thing&#39;s for sure, you&#39;re DEFINITELY getting your content for your subscribers tonight! 

Thankfully for the moment you seem to be in the clear, so you scramble away from the basement door and slump down against the wall to catch your breath. The plantation [[settles around you,-&gt;HS Recovery]] as if it was watching your escape with bated breath. </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="59" name="Spider Bad End" tags="HS badend" position="1185,1110" size="100,100">And it doesn&#39;t come. 

Quietly sobbing to yourself, praying, apologizing, begging, bargaining... you stop, and feel immense confusion, and turn back to slowly look at the... 

EW you don&#39;t wanna look at it, ew, ew ew GROSS. 

You shiver. The spider taps at your back with one of its legs, and trails its fuzzy toe-claw up your back, and you shiver harder and... it kinda makes a trilling, chirpy sort of noise? And now you&#39;re even more scared because if it doesn&#39;t just wanna kill you, then what does it... 

NONONO you&#39;re not gonna look at it you hate it it&#39;s disgusting don&#39;t look at it. 

You instead, try to look around, and see what you can see. Your eyes have mostly adjusted to the dark, but it&#39;s not much help because it&#39;s just, nearly pitch black down here, and the only light you can see is the fast-fading light from the stairwell... and your dropped phone, laying there on the ground... shining its flashlight on you as it records your demise. Yes. You were recording. You ARE recording. Whoever shows up to rescue you, will find your phone and get to watch as you... 

You feel a tug, on one leg? And then... the other?? And... 
what the fuck is it doing you twist and look back and WHAT IS THAT FUCKING THING you scream and yell and scramble around and flail in the web and can&#39;t move and you feel a claw scrape your ASSCHEEKS as it punctures the rear of your jeans and cuts a hole in the fabric and

Well. That was an ordeal. You bury your head in your arms for a minute and catch your breath and listen to the quiet house around you. Damn, damn, damn. Fuck. FUCK. That thing ALMOST GOT YOU. Who knows... you might&#39;ve been down there for hours, days even, before finally dying or being killed... if it had webbed you up like... ugh. You shudder. It&#39;s just not even worth thinking about... 

You pull your phone out. &quot;Ok. Ok guys. I am just. I&#39;m fuckin&#39; traumatized. I know y&#39;all saw that spider thing for a few seconds at least. I&#39;m sorry I couldn&#39;t get a better shot of it. If I get outta this, I&#39;m gonna go buy a damn GoPro, right away, and all my future videos will have like, first-person content. No more of this smartphone shakycam bullshit ok?&quot; You try to make your voice sound lighthearted but you are DEFINITELY afraid. 

&quot;Uhh... gonna just. Head upstairs, I guess. I might not go to bed? But I just wanna find a place to relax for a minute. Damn I hope there&#39;s no more... spiders. Or that other thing. Fuck dude.&quot; You shut your phone off and head around the corner, up the hall towards the front door. The stairs are waiting for you. 

You [[climb them.-&gt;Upstairs Landing]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="61" name="Spider Bad End 2" tags="HS badend" position="1307,1116" size="100,100">You are now full-on crying. You&#39;re trying to be quiet still, just out of habit, because you&#39;re a guy, and guys don&#39;t cry, but guys also usually don&#39;t have... 

BIG FLOPPY SQUISHY SPIDER PEEN being shoved inside their anus. So. You can afford some tears. 

You didn&#39;t get a good look at it. It&#39;s too dark to really discern much detail, especially with your own body blocking much of the light from below from reaching the spider itself. But... it was... phallic. More of a dull pinkish purple color than the rest of the spider&#39;s gray tone. 

The spider pushes it deep into your belly and encircles you in a few of its long, hairy legs. What, is that supposed to be comforting or something? Apparently it thinks so. One of its legs... 

for FUCK&#39;s sake, reaches up to ruffle your hair. 
Yes. 
Really. 

You are being mounted by a massive fairy-tale fucking spider, it has some kinda penis-thing impaling your ASS, and it&#39;s //caressing you like a passionate lover.// It&#39;s SPOONING you. 

You feel the spider-dick throb and pulse and gush... uggh. You&#39;re angry-crying now. How utterly... undignified and terrible. You don&#39;t have time to stay indignant though because you feel it throbbing again but this time it&#39;s more... solid?? 

You let out a loud, plaintive wail. 
[[She&#39;s laying an egg in your belly.-&gt;Spider Bad End 3]] </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="62" name="Spider Bad End 3" tags="HS badend" position="1440,1092" size="100,100">From her abdomen, to yours. 
You feel the soft egg stretch your hole wider as it rolls along the ovipositor, and glides into its new nest smoothly. Your body shudders. You twitch and your hands flex and your feet spasm. You gasp. You yelp. 

Another egg is on its way. Again, it slides in smooth. You... you can&#39;t. You make an attempt at clenching shut, and you just. Can&#39;t. The spider&#39;s... lady-spider-dick... //ovipositor// motherfucker... is keeping you wide open. It&#39;s like, those things they put in your mouth at the dentist when they&#39;re filling a cavity? But it&#39;s your ass, and it&#39;s being filled with eggs. 

Or more appropriately, your gut. 

You are completely powerless to stop it. You hang there for... hours. You lose track of time and your consciousness fades in and out. Egg after rolling round soft squishy EGG. 

Plop. 

Plop. 

.... plop. 

The web sags with your increasing weight. 
You&#39;re mildly roused when you finally feel an emptiness behind you; the spider retracts its schlong and scuttles away into the darkness. Possibly to sleep, or find food... you don&#39;t care. About anything anymore. 

It&#39;s pitch black. Your phone&#39;s battery must have died. You... you feel so full. You feel //huge.// You have no idea how many eggs are inside you and you don&#39;t want to know and all you know is that you are now a nest. A living egg sac, dangling from the web of a horrifically huge, horny spider-mama. Papa. Thing. Fuck it. Fuck it all. You&#39;re pregnant. 

**END** 

You were impregnated by a gigantic spider, loaded to the brim with eggs, packed obscenely full. Your vast round lumpy egg-filled belly sags below you, and the term egg //sack// has never been more appropriate. You&#39;re basically a flesh-colored bag with arms and legs and a head, when the authorities show up. The eggs inside you grow, and grow, and turn you into a huge sphere. 

&quot;What the //fucking fuck,//&quot; you hear a voice say in front of you. You also hear scratchy radio noises, and other voices fade into your senses, and... ugh. 

You moan and try to raise your head. You can&#39;t move your arms or legs, which are draped limply, uselessly, over the tight round ball your torso has become. 

&quot;He&#39;s ALIVE,&quot; another voice says. 

&quot;I want round-the-clock security until we can figure out how to move him without damaging the specimens,&quot; a far more authoritative voice barks out. &quot;We&#39;ll need samples, and a medical unit for this poor young man.&quot; 

&quot;What&#39;s classification on this one?&quot; asks a younger, female voice. 

&quot;We&#39;ll go with Euclid Class, until we capture it and prove otherwise. Mobile Task Force Lambda-12 is deploying as we speak.&quot; 

The eggs squirm and tickle your innards, and you feel a dopey smile spread across your face. 
Yay, you&#39;re being rescued. Yay. </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="63" name="Plod on Up" tags="RG" position="672,895" size="100,100">You sigh and begin to climb the stairs, one heavy footstep at a time. You&#39;ll have to just take it slow and breath smoothly. Fuck. A staircase has NEVER troubled you like this before... but then, you&#39;ve never been this full before. And with ghost food. That can&#39;t be good for your metabolism. Hopefully it doesn&#39;t turn into like, an extra fifty pounds of fat. 

Suddenly you hear loud, pounding footsteps thundering up the hall, coming towards you! You lean over the railing and HOLY SHIT WHAT THE FUCK IS THAT THING??!? It&#39;s some kind of huge, hairy... bear or beast or SOMETHING. It&#39;s got glowing fucking eyes, man!! And it&#39;s stomping up the hall your way and it&#39;s about to just-- 

You yell and scramble up the stairs as fast as you can before it gets to the bottom of the stairs. 

&quot;Heh he heheh heh... hawhawhaw...&quot; 

it&#39;s laughing at you
the monster is laughing at 
you
and it sounds like... Beau??

&quot;You don&#39; look too happy to see me again, hawhawhaw,&quot; it rumbles up the stairs at you. It&#39;s just. He. He&#39;s standing there like he&#39;s waiting for you to fall down the staircase or something. &quot;//I hope you&#39;re enjoyin&#39; your stay,// hawhawhawhaw...&quot; 

&quot;... Beau?&quot; you whisper, terrified. You cling to the bannister at the top of the stairs. You really should just run but if he can talk, then he... might be able to be reasoned with... 

oh who the FUCK are you kidding. He starts to stomp up the stairs towards you. &quot;Haw haw haw... [[Say where you goin, smol fren? C&#39;mon over here to Beau-&gt;Beau Stairs Stuck]]...

It&#39;s not as cushy as you&#39;d hoped, but you&#39;re too stuffed to be picky. You&#39;re just, gonna take a little nap, yeah? You sigh and slump down with your hands folded over your belly. 

**time passes** 

... and you rouse yourself, blinking. It&#39;s dark. Very, very dark. You must have fallen asleep for a few hours... where are you again? And... why are you in this comfy chair... ugh. 

You gather yourself. You&#39;ve still got a plumped-up gut unfortunately. It&#39;s not quite as big as it was, and doesn&#39;t feel as overwhelmingly tight or heavy, but well... let&#39;s just say you&#39;ve got a ways to go before you&#39;re nice and digested. You still feel kinda drowsy. Why&#39;d you wake up anyway? 

You yawn quietly and start to sit up, and you hear the front door creeeaak open, accompanied by a deep growl from just outside, in the main hall. It&#39;s pretty loud and you freeze with a primal fear. Something&#39;s just entered the mansion with you. And it&#39;s on this floor. And these old rooms have a lot of damaged, missing, worn-down doors. 

A few slow, heavy footsteps thump down on the hardwood flooring of the hall, clicking on occasion with the sound of claws... somewhere... behind you. Shivering, you slowly peek around the side of the antique chair. You hear the monstrous footsteps starting to fade and just manage to catch a shadowy glimpse of movement. 

Not even ten feet from you. 
Whatever it is, has gone into the dining room. Fuck, you can hear it... //sniffing.// It sounds like some huge dog or something. Your eyes are accustomed to the dark by now but it&#39;s SO dark you&#39;re still blind beyond a certain distance. Everything is shadows and shapes and blackness. 

Maybe you can... wait here. Maybe it&#39;ll move on. If you just relax and [[pretend you&#39;re not here...-&gt;Wait In The Chair]]

Or, you could fuckin&#39; MOVE, seeing as how it&#39;s trying to pick up a scent apparently. The only problem is, you&#39;re still stuffed-enough-to-look-bloated and ghost food is HEAVY and you know you&#39;re not only going to be slower than usual, but... noisier. With your increased weight. 

So do you want to risk [[moving?-&gt;Rounded Run]] </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="65" name="Check Back Door" tags="RG" position="287,838" size="100,100">You take careful steps down the hallway. The boards creak under your feet; they might be quieter if you were... a little lighter. Urrggh. **burp!** 

You&#39;re about 15 feet away from the wide-open back door when you hear something that is not your own footsteps, breathing, or abdomen trying to process ethereal food. It&#39;s the sound of more wood creaking, under... some very big, heavy footsteps. 

Up ahead, a dark shape approaches from the gloomy night, climbing up the back porch&#39;s stairs towards the door. You freeze. 

What. The FUCK. Is that. 
It has gleaming eyes, high above the ground, and... pointed ears, and... what little moonlight there is, sort of just disappears behind the creature&#39;s bulk. 

You... you can&#39;t even run. You&#39;re heavy, overstuffed, short-of-breath from the pressure in your body. You back away slowly. 

It&#39;s absolutely, positively, a werewolf. 
And you are going to die. No, for real. There&#39;s no place to hide, nowhere to run but back down this long hallway, where you are at a complete disadvantage, and... and it&#39;s definitely already seen you. 

So you do the only thing you can think to do, and that&#39;s raise your phone, recording the hulking beast&#39;s approach. It&#39;s tongue runs over its moist fangs. A droopy thick tail can be seen dangling, swaying down between its enormous legs, as gigantic footsteps seem to make the whole house shudder and groan. 

&quot;I&#39;m gonna die, you guys. I love you all,&quot; you whisper. 

&quot;You gonna REALLY love me in a second heah, nah!&quot; the monster... says??

Standin&#39; there brave as ever-- OH. Ohohohoho. HAA! I see nah. I see. Look like somebody been eatin&#39; at MAMMY&#39;s kitchen, nah.&quot; 

&quot;... //Beau??//&quot; you rasp out. 

&quot;Heh! Heheh. What gave it away? The overalls?&quot; The huge werewolf looms over you. You see that he is, in fact, wearing a tattered pair of overalls, with the straps undone over his massive furry torso. &quot;Shoo! If I didn&#39;t know bettah, I&#39;d guess some OTHER beast pumped a baby or two in ya,&quot; and he gestures toward your bloated belly. &quot;But I bet that&#39;s Mammy Vi&#39;s fault, huh?&quot; 

&quot;You&#39;re a werewolf??&quot; you squeak. 

&quot;Well. Technically yes, but...&quot; he grins down at you, showing every single one of his fangs. &quot;Down HEAH in CAJUN country, we call &#39;em //Le Rougarou.//&quot; He shrugs and chuckles. &quot;O&#39;course, it mean pretty much the same thing nah, but hey.&quot; 

His vast hands gently encircle your body. You&#39;re completely at his mercy now. Your only defense against any foul intentions, is your wits and your voice. And the fact that there&#39;ll be video evidence. You swallow hard. &quot;I&#39;m recording you, by the way. Livestreaming this. I managed to get... a few bars. Everyone&#39;s gonna see you kill--&quot; 

It&#39;s a lie, and it&#39;s all you&#39;ve got... and he doesn&#39;t fall for it. 

&quot;Hmm... //live//streamin, eh?&quot; Beau clutches you in his left hand-- squeezing your belly uncomfortably as he lifts you up like a toy. His other hand rubs his whiskered chin. You see nasty looking claws on his fingertips. &quot;Fuckin&#39; in front of an audience... That&#39;s kinda hot, not gonna lie. Never thought to do that before.&quot; 

&quot;... wha--?&quot; you frown. That seems to be an odd response. Doesn&#39;t he... want to kill you?? Isn&#39;t that what werewolves do?? 

And then you realize that he&#39;s got... TWO long dark floppy things dangling down there. One in the back, which is actually his bushy werew--rougarou tail. And uhh... 

Well shucks, that&#39;s a penis. Just. On full display. His overalls are split at the seams between the legs; it looks like they couldn&#39;t handle the mass of his thighs as he turned into his beast-form. 

Beau smiles when he realizes you&#39;re staring. Within a second, it rises to full attention, pointing directly at your face. &quot;Don&#39;t worry, smol fren. I will be... pretty gentle with you.&quot; 

[[Uh-oh-&gt;Beau Bloat Badend 2]]. </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="67" name="Beau Bloat Badend 2" tags="RG badend" position="33,969" size="100,100">&quot;So, here&#39;s what //I&#39;m// thinkin&#39; nah,&quot; Beau says. He turns you around to face away from him, and his gigantic bulging furry arms wrap around your body tightly. You feel his schlong slide up your spine and drool precum down your back. Your phone is... aimed down at the floor, as your hands are now pinned to your sides. 

&quot;I&#39;m thinkin,&quot; Beau continues, &quot;I&#39;m thinkin&#39; of a dumb, stupid idea, that&#39;s gonna make some //money.// At least I hope. I dunno. I&#39;m not a very smart sumbitch, I guarantee.&quot; His arms are basically a prison of muscles. Your feet dangle uselessly below. You let out a small, scared little **belch**. 

Beau buries his face between your legs for a moment and takes a deep breath, sighing peacefully. &quot;First, I&#39;m goin&#39; to fuck you, like you never been fucked by anythin&#39; on this earth.&quot; 

He places you carefully on a chair, flat on your back, and holds you there with one hand on your chest. His other hand tugs your jeans off. &quot;You keep recordin&#39; all this foreplay nah, this is important, I guarantee. Actually wait. Better idea.&quot; He grabs your phone out of your hands and gets some shots of you, vulnerable, pants-less, cringing, fearful. And then he reaches over and leans your phone upright to film the whole thing. 

&quot;Nah. What we got here, is a boy. As y&#39;all can clearly see.&quot; Beau addresses the camera. &quot;And me? Well I&#39;m just. Nobody special nah. A good ol&#39; Southern boy, that&#39;s for sure. And I also happen to be the wildest ride on earth.&quot; 

He grins down at you. 

[[&quot;I guaran-TEE.-&gt;Beau Bloat Badend 3]] </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="68" name="Beau Bloat Badend 3" tags="RG badend" position="31,1095" size="100,100">There&#39;s really nothing that can prepare you for when his fat rougarou shaft plunges into your rear end. There&#39;s no resisting either. He grips around your knees and cracks your legs wide open. 
And that&#39;s it, just like that you&#39;re being fucked by a werewolf. 
//Rougarou.// What the fuck ever! 

&quot;As you can clearly see, I will fuck ANY hole that comes my way,&quot; Beau continues to address his audience. He hefts your hindquarters up higher; your stomach is still swollen and you moan with the pressure. &quot;But, this here HUUUGE BODY,&quot; and he pauses to flex his fur-covered bulk for the camera, &quot;needs a lotta food, and a lotta fuckin, and... Hold up, hold up. Money shot, smol fren, here comes!&quot; 

You cringe away in anticipation, not that it does you any good when BOOSH. BOOSH. BOOSH. 
BOOSH. BOOSH. BlOrP. BLORp. bLOrp. 
Blorp. Blub. blub... blub... 
glub. 
Each ridiculous blast of hot cum gushes into you and makes your poor belly swell visibly bigger, and inch by inch, you start to look... fucking //pregnant.// You grunt and groan and whimper. 

And much to your chagrin, Beau chuckles and wriggles your hips down, impaling you further on his cock, until he nudges... some kind of terrifying pressure point deel within your bowels, and your head tilts back and you //yell// and spray your own... pathetic-by-comparison load. All over his crotch. 

&quot;So. If you want ol&#39; Beau here to knock you up, you just c&#39;mon down to Bayou Lourde, y&#39;hear? I&#39;mma put a link in the description to mah new website.&quot; Beau pats your bulging, beach-ball-sized, cum-filled globe of a body. &quot;Beau will give you the night of your LIFE, and make you pregnant as FUCK. I guaranTEE!&quot; 

**END** 

Well ain&#39;t that a bitch. 
Not only did you get impregnated by a rougarou, you got yourself //used for someone else&#39;s promotional material without permission or compensation!!// 

The only real consolation you get out of the whole thing is that-- and this is Beau&#39;s logic here-- you had a nice amount of ghostly nutrition waiting to be used, from Mammy&#39;s cooking, and it spurs the development of your horrible little werewolf-rougarou-pup-baby-thing. Which comes out the same way it got in, after about a week of you being stuck in the plantation, or in Beau&#39;s fishing shack hidden on the island, or... wherever he wants you, really. 

Thankfully he doesn&#39;t... wolf-out again and fuck you anymore. Apparently he doesn&#39;t feel the need to, which makes about as much sense as anything else that&#39;s happened to you. 

You try to put this all behind you as you return home, and try to get your subscribers to just... stop asking. But all it takes is one of them to go looking for furry porn or something, and they recognize YOU laying there being fucked full of Beau&#39;s baby batter, and... you actually //gain// a few subscribers. 

Beau&#39;s channel though. Blows up faster than you did while he was fucking you. Millions. Millions of people. Watch him, make the journey, contribute to his video count and earn him a ton of money... 

Fuck your life, right? </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="69" name="Wait In The Chair" tags="RG" position="321,1064" size="100,100">You... might be too scared to move. It happens to the best of us. It&#39;s always an inconvenience too, seeing as how being frozen with fear makes it rather difficult to get away from whatever&#39;s got you scared. 

You remain quiet, and still, and listen. You start to hear some footsteps again... getting a little louder. The floorboards creak under its weight. 

Ok. You&#39;ve got to think, think, THINK. Uhh. You&#39;re not sure you can run fast enough to outrun this thing, and you&#39;ve already elected to try hiding, so... ffffuck it&#39;s so stressful. Everything is a threat, everything! The inky black shapes all around you, the... sheets... 

Hmm... there&#39;s lots of furniture in here. The chair you&#39;re in currently, there&#39;s a couch over there, there&#39;s a lounge, a table... hmm. That floor lamp over there is about your height... and that fancy old couch, looks like it&#39;s got a veritable crawlspace under it. For one wild second, you consider what it&#39;d be like to try hiding in, or even climbing up OUT the chimney... but then your belly gives a little gurgle and you quickly realize that with your bloated figure, that would be a very, very bad idea. 

You&#39;ve got to act fast if you&#39;re going to hide from that thing. 
Do you: 

[[crawl under the couch-&gt;Rounded Under Couch]]? 

or

[[head for the floor lamp-&gt;Rounded Lampshade]]? </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="70" name="Rounded Run" tags="RG" position="463,1222" size="100,100">Fuck this, you&#39;re running. Or, well... moving as quickly and quietly as possible. No way are you sitting around here getting eaten. 

You peer around the corner one last time when you hear the footsteps tromp down the hall. You&#39;re able to fire yourself up and stand, //quietly,// and look around the room. You can hear the footsteps getting further away, fading... silence. 

You&#39;ve got at least two options here: 

At the opposite end of the room is an open threshold-- you saw it earlier when there was more light, and it won&#39;t take you long to find it again. If you think you can slip away into some other area of the manor-- perhaps out the back door--[[you might wanna head here-&gt;Parlor Rounded]]. 

If you feel like living dangerously though, you might consider creeping out to the main Hallway. Didn&#39;t that thing come in through the front door? Hmm. It&#39;s risky, but maybe you could try to trick it somehow... but you&#39;ll need to [[check the Hallway first.-&gt;Round Hall Run]] 
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="71" name="Rounded Under Couch" tags="RG" position="326,1349" size="100,100">You quietly flatten yourself out as best you can-- not easy with your belly all bloated up like a damn beer-guzzling frat bro-- and scoot under the couch. Fuck, it&#39;s like... it&#39;s like you&#39;re playing hide-and-seek. You try to relax and not breathe loudly. 

Mmff. There&#39;s just enough space... to turn your head to the right, and look out. The back of the couch has a sort of arch to it, likely an attempt to be more fancy or some shit. And the sheet covering the couch misses the floor by about... an inch? So you&#39;re able to see the doorframe leading out into the hall.

And you&#39;re able to see the great big clawed feet that suddenly appear, stomping slowly into the living room. You shiver, and clap your hand to your mouth. Don&#39;t breathe. Don&#39;t breathe. Well ok... breathe slowly but do it QUIETLY. 

The monster thumps closer. You can hear it breathing, a snuffly sort of noise that only a huge beast would make anyway. You slowly turn your head left, towards the front of the couch. You watch the feet go across the room, to the fireplace. More sniffs, more tiny little growls. They don&#39;t sound outright hostile, more... pensive than anything. Like it&#39;s considering its options. 

Fuck. 
It pulls the sheet off the lamp!! Good thing you didn&#39;t hide over there, right?? You close your eyes, and then you hear a... a click. 

The lamp comes on. Your eyes pop wide open and a new sort of fear grips you, along with a choking tangle of questions. The house has an electrical lamp? The house has POWER?? And most importantly: //The monster knows how to turn a fucking lamp on?!?// 

You see it bend low, and there&#39;s a brief glimpse of a canine-looking set of jaws, much larger than any dog you&#39;ve ever seen. Like... a werewolf or something. It&#39;s looking under one of the chairs, or into the fireplace... 

You make a hasty decision: 

[[Stay still and put,-&gt;Round Hide CouchSuccess]] and hope it doesn&#39;t decide to check under this couch. You&#39;re too scared to move anyway. 

[[Crawl out the back-&gt;Couch Hide Fail]] while it&#39;s distracted, and sneak away. </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="72" name="Rounded Lampshade" tags="RG" position="447,1091" size="100,100">It almost seems ridiculous to think it&#39;ll actually work, but... you&#39;ve committed. It&#39;s either gonna work, or you&#39;re fuckin&#39; dead. You move as quick-yet-quiet as you can across the big living room, heading for the floor lamp in the corner. It&#39;s a big antique artpiece, basically-- a large flared shade creates ample space below under the sheet where you can stand. 

You grip the back of the sheet to hold it still. You can&#39;t have it making ANY motion-- although, to be fair, the house is drafty enough to make all the sheet-draped furniture flutter from time to time. Ok. Ok just relax. You&#39;ve got this. You&#39;re covered. You look just like another piece of furniture. Now you just have to hold //still// and not... 

**urp** 

oh fuck. 
you wince down at your gut. That better be the last noise it makes... because the heavy, thunderous footsteps of the monster have just entered the living room. It sounds like they came from the far side-- you haven&#39;t explored in that room yet, but from what you saw earlier it looked like some sort of parlor or writing den? 

Fuck, you can SEE IT, it&#39;s just this huge black shadowy shape, looming in the room. Terror clutches at your soul when you see the two pinpricks of gleaming light, halfway to the high ceiling. It&#39;s. Very tall. Very wide. Whatever it is... could it be a bear?? Do they even have those here?? 

//It&#39;s bipedal.// You hear it sniff. You see it coming closer, moving among the main group of furniture. It sniffs the chair you&#39;d slept in earlier. 

And it lets out a low grunt, its large head trailing down... it&#39;s right. in front. of you. It&#39;s so close you could probably take a couple steps and touch it. You hear it breathing. The head turns in your direction for a moment and you feel two puffs of hot breath waft over your face. 

It leans down and sniffs at the floor, and then follows... your footsteps. From earlier. Out into the hall. It&#39;s retracing your steps. 

[[It&#39;s leaving.-&gt;Rounded MomSucc Lamp]] </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="73" name="Rounded MomSucc Lamp" tags="RG" position="594,1021" size="100,100">Holy crap. That worked?? Wow. You carefully, quietly slide out from under the sheet. It&#39;s just a thin white king-sized sheet; if it&#39;d been earlier in the day, the monster might have actually seen you through it... so you&#39;re blessed by the presence of such darkness. 

Mm. Your stomach gurgles, but rather pleasantly, and... in fact, you think you feel it //shrink// a little, so that&#39;s nice. You steady your breathing and listen for the beast. 

It&#39;s still on this floor. All you can think is to creep towards the threshold leading into the hallway, and... get upstairs. As quietly as possible. Hopefully they aren&#39;t too creaky. 

//Oh shit they are!!// 

Loud, rapid-fire thuds come pounding from the other room, and the hulking beast is RIGHT THERE, just... RIGHT behind you, huffing and snarling and... 

laughing? 

&quot;Ehheheheheh. I KNEW I heard you creepin&#39; around in here... hawhawhaw.&quot; 

Your eyes go wide as you scramble upstairs and turn to face him. It&#39;s... it&#39;s definitely Beau&#39;s voice. Gruffer and slightly deeper and louder... but it&#39;s his voice and accent. 

&quot;Beau??&quot; you ask. 

&quot;Heheh. Sho&#39; am,&quot; he growls, chuckling quietly. He&#39;s... he&#39;s a monster?? He&#39;s HUGE. Fucking enormous, like... 9, 10 feet tall? Hairy and pointy eared and pointy-fanged and pointy-clawed... gigantic burly limbs and massive hands and feet... 

&quot;How the...&quot; you step backwards, watching him advance up each step, slowly and menacingly, like he&#39;s [[got all the time in the world.-&gt;Beau Stairs Stuck]] </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="74" name="Beau Stairs Stuck" tags="RG Stairs" position="1088,1293" size="100,100">You back away from the stairs slowly. &quot;Listen Beau, I... what the FUCK are you, in the first place, and... and what do you want from me??&quot; 

&quot;Hmmhmm, hawhaw, it&#39;s a //surprise,// smol fren,&quot; Beau says as his hulking figure ascends the stairs. Slowly. Step. By Step. Up. And up. &quot;Hmm. I could tell you, sure. But. It would be much more fun to just. Show you...&quot; 

&quot;Look, uhh, is this a prank or something?&quot; you ask. &quot;Are you... do you got cameras set up?&quot; Sheesh. You hadn&#39;t even thought of it before, but it&#39;s perfect, isn&#39;t it? It&#39;s all dark, he&#39;s probably just got a cheap-ass costume on that wouldn&#39;t hold up under scrutiny in brighter lighting... tryin&#39; to scare you with that local-yokel &quot;rougarou&quot; shit. 

&quot;Hmm. Cameras. You got the only camera in here, lil man, I guaran-TEE,&quot; Beau chortles. He&#39;s getting too close to the top of the stairs. You can see real drool starting to trickle from his fanged jaws. That&#39;s a real tongue lickin&#39; those chops, and this... this ain&#39;t a prank. 

&quot;Ok, ok look. Beau. Uhh. How many subscribers do you have? Didn&#39;t you say... like twenty or so? How&#39;d you like it if I promoted your channel??&quot; 

Well what else can you offer him?? Sexual favors??!? Shit, if it means you get to live... 

Suddenly Beau stops cold. &quot;Subscribers? Hmm. Uhh. Mom, Dad, uhh, Aunt Jo over in the next parrish... Uncle Ti-Jean... Peggy from church... that&#39;s uhh, one, two... three four five six seven, who else is there... eight... nine ten... eleven...? Twelve? There ain&#39;t no more than that, right? Wait wait wait. One, two... three four, five, six, seven...&quot; 

You back down the hallway, away from him. He continues to count. &quot;Twelve, I think, right? I... wait wait hold on nah. Wait up. You don&#39;t go nowhere, y&#39;hear? Lemme try to remember.&quot; 

//What the fuck?!?// You didn&#39;t think he was this dumb... he can&#39;t count higher than twelve?? 

Fuck it, you gotta move. &quot;Hey uhh... do you know how many stairs you just climbed to get up here?&quot; you ask, and he looks down at the stairs. 

His gleaming eyes glare at them. &quot;Well, uhh... there&#39;s one, two, three...&quot; 

You creep down the hallway and [[slide into a dark room-&gt;Beau Stairs Stuck 2]]. </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="75" name="Beau Stairs Stuck 2" tags="RG Stairs" position="1188,1455" size="100,100">&quot;Nah what the FUCK??&quot; Beau snaps as he climbs back down the stairs. &quot;One, two, three, four... five six... seven... eight nine ten &#39;leven twelve... wait wait wait. What... what in the sam hill... one, two...&quot; 

He&#39;s stuck? On the number twelve?? Is this some kinda superstitious shit or is he actually that illiterate? You... shit, you don&#39;t even care, as long as he&#39;s all bamboozled, and not focused on you. 

Still, not something you see everyday-- a werewolf who can&#39;t count past twelve. Must have something to do with the phases of the moon or midnight or... who knows. He&#39;s confused and not focused on you. 

You use this time to slip around the corner and duck into a dark room. You hear him counting still, never going past 12, until he growls and snaps his jaws. &quot;Wait. Wait where&#39;d you go, smol fren?? You... you get... FUCK I gotta go find out how many subscribers I got... I&#39;mma come BACK FOR YOU THOUGH LIL MAN, I guaran//tee...&quot;// 

And you hear him stomp out of the house. 

You slump against the wall and breathe a sigh of relief. Definitely not how you&#39;d expect to defeat a werewolf, but maybe you&#39;ll look up legends on the Internet sometime and get this shit sorted. Meanwhile, you&#39;ve made it upstairs and [[there&#39;s more things to explore-&gt;Upstairs Landing]] and you SURE aren&#39;t going back down there while he&#39;s wandering around... </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="76" name="Upstairs Landing" tags="Stairs" position="1336,1402" size="100,100">You&#39;re upstairs: high above the first floor, standing on a landing padded with thick carpet. You take a few deep breaths. It&#39;s already been a thrilling night so far. You&#39;ve managed to get a little footage, a few pictures... but you need MORE content. You decide you&#39;ll take a quick breather, get some pics, scope out the rooms up here, and go from there. 

All while listening carefully for any unappealing sounds from downstairs. If they sound like fun profitable ghost activity, you might head on back down, but anything that sounds actively dangerous... yeah. Not worth your life. After all, you can&#39;t be an Internet star if you&#39;re dead! That&#39;s what the //ghosts// are for! 

Sheesh, most of these rooms are LOCKED. Or the doors are broken, or hanging off the hinges, and everything&#39;s dark n&#39; spooky and... well, there&#39;s one bedroom that looks promising. Got a nice four-poster bed setup with a fancy canopy that billows every so often. It&#39;s probably the best place you&#39;re gonna find, when you finally decide to sleep. 
Shit, you could [[do that now,-&gt;Off to Bed]] if you wanted. Maybe you being up and about is actually scaring the ghosts off, like how everyone&#39;s parents say Santa won&#39;t come if you&#39;re still awake. 

There&#39;s some windows at the end of this long hallway, letting in an eerie glow of moonlight. You&#39;ve got to find... either, plenty of ghostly activity, or at least some clues about the people who used to live here. 

Next to those windows is a door that has... light, coming out from under it. Faint orange-y light, just a small glow, like what you might see when you get up in the middle of the night to pee and your roommate&#39;s already in the bathroom so you gotta wait. You can [[head down the hall-&gt;VWitch Intro]] and check it out. 

Next to that door-- closer to your position-- is, surprise surprise! Another door. Could lead to a bedroom... or a bathroom? Why not [[check it out?-&gt;LockedLibrary]] 
And then there&#39;s that door, all the way at the other end. There&#39;s also windows at that end, but no moonlight coming in, making it a spooky, darkened end of the hallway... but it&#39;s not so dark you can&#39;t see the odd, splotchy patterns on the carpet that look like they might be stains from... well, food, wine, or perhaps bodily fluids... [[Sounds like a mystery to solve,-&gt;Early FP]] no? </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="77" name="Off to Bed" tags="IW end" position="1771,1464" size="100,100">Well, hey. You&#39;re definitely a little tired, and you&#39;ve been through enough tonight haven&#39;t you? Maybe it&#39;d be a good time to head off, find yourself a nice place to sleep... 

You check out the few bedrooms that are open to you. You&#39;re not sure you trust the beds, but one of the rooms has a nice cushy-looking chair with an overstuffed ottoman. You give them both a little kick just to see if any like, roaches come crawling out or anything. Nah. Looks fine. 

You sink down. You get a dusty cloud around you, but you just wave that away. You pull your phone out for a little bit and record one last vlog for the video: &quot;Well guys,&quot; you whisper, &quot;it&#39;s late, I&#39;m tired, I&#39;m gonna get some sleep but you bet if any ghosts or other shit wakes me up, I&#39;mma record it for you, ok? Gooood night!&quot; You tap the screen like you&#39;re fist-bumping your subscribers, and then shut your phone off and shove it down in your pocket. 

You begin to drift off...

&quot;Mmm-mmmmm,&quot; you moan in your half-asleep state. What. A. DREAM. Hot as fuck. You barely remember it. You... it was fuckin&#39; sexy. Your dick is a steel rod. You&#39;re bent over the... ottoman? that you were resting your feet on previously. Mmm. Humping it. Heheh. Hey. Hey no one will know. 

Wait a sec what were you dreaming about? Man there was... there were some hands all over you, right? Holding you tight, pulling you down? Into... onto... wait. wait wait. FFFFuck your... your boner. You&#39;re intensely aroused; it&#39;s hard to think. And you&#39;re just. Getting. Harder! 

&quot;AHhhh....&quot; you stretch your arms out in front of you and grind against the ottoman. You are going to impregnate this ottoman. &quot;Mmmmfff...&quot; 

Wow, that was some dream. 

Intense pleasure ZINGS up through your lowest reaches, your bowels, your navel, all the way up, back down, you&#39;re shivering and you lay atop the ottoman lazily because FUCK you can&#39;t even hold yourself up. You moan. 

... wait was that you?

Items made from wicker and silky fabrics and colorful carpets all along the ground. There&#39;s a table with tarot cards laying around a cloudy crystal ball. 

The woman herself is difficult to pin down, as far as age and lifestyle goes. She has a slender face and build, wearing a light skirt and a thin tank top. Her skin&#39;s like dark chocolate; she&#39;s got dreads tied back in a big ponytail. Whenever you meet her gaze, you feel almost rooted to the spot, like you&#39;re not allowed to look away until she&#39;s done studying you. 

&quot;Don&#39;t mind the mess,&quot; she says with a gesture towards some leaves and other ingredients scattered about. &quot;I&#39;ve been busy workin&#39; on a fresh series o&#39; hexes for the surroundin&#39; area.&quot; 

&quot;A hex? Like real-life magic?&quot; 

&quot;... you believe?&quot; she asks with a little smile, turning to face you. &quot;How about that. Rare to find someone these days who takes me seriously.&quot; 

&quot;... well I&#39;ve finally seen real, actual, floating haunting ghosts, and gotten them on video,&quot; you say, holding up your phone. &quot;So it&#39;d be kind of stupid and stubborn of me to think that other supernatural things aren&#39;t real as well.&quot;

&quot;Hey. HEY,&quot; she snaps. &quot;That phone. That phone better be off. I won&#39;t have any cameras on me.&quot; As she waggles her hand at you, many bracelets jingle and clack together. 

&quot;Ok ok, I understand, it&#39;s not on and I&#39; m not recording,&quot; you say quickly to placate her. &quot;I would have asked you before I started to record.&quot; 

&quot;Hmm. Well den.&quot; She puts her hands on her hips. &quot;I&#39;m not in the mood to be interviewed, so I will ask the questions, and you will provide the answers, and then I&#39;ll decide if I want to keep you around or not.&quot; 

&quot;Sure sure,&quot; you say with a charming smile. &quot;I don&#39;t want to be a bother, and I don&#39;t mean to intrude.&quot; 

&quot;Hush now,&quot; she says. &quot;First you will tell me your name, and why you are here.&quot;

Yeah... those aren&#39;t exactly grape juice stains. You&#39;re not sure if they&#39;re old BLOOD stains but they&#39;re stains alright. 

... ok, they might just be mold or some shit. 

Either way. This looks like a pretty interesting... 

You bang into the door as you try to push it open. 

It&#39;s not //locked,// either. There&#39;s no doorknob! Just... a flat tarnished brassy plate where a doorknob should be. But usually, locked doors have just a little bit of //give// to them when you push on them. They shake a little, right? 

This one feels more like a solid wall. No give whatsoever. 

And when you give it a few bangs, a few knocks... it just doesn&#39;t sound like a door. It doesn&#39;t sound wooden. Sounds more like metal, almost? 

[[You&#39;ll have to try again later.-&gt;Upstairs Landing]] </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="80" name="Parlor Rounded" tags="RG end" position="602,1136" size="100,100">Ok. You&#39;re just gonna... gonna creep over, past the chairs, past that sheet-covered piano or whatever that thing is, past the fireplace and the bookshelf and the cute little table. You step into the next room-- a parlor of sorts. That thing over there might be a desk, and there&#39;s... hmm. An ottoman in front of you? 

You scope the room out. It&#39;s WAY darker than the living room, at least, away from the windows. This side of the house isn&#39;t getting much moonlight at all-- perhaps that&#39;s due to the ivy and other plantlife creeping up these windows and blocking them. 

There&#39;s likely a door off... to the left somewhere. Leading back into the hallway. Seems logical enough. You tiptoe carefully, taking long but slow and purposeful strides. You can&#39;t afford to kick anything and make any noise, so every time you step, you take just a sec to make sure nothing&#39;s up ahead. That&#39;s not easy, since it&#39;s so dark, and the door up ahead seems to be even darker. 

You feel for the archway around the door-- the wooden molding that wraps the arch all fancy-like-- and take another step. 

You plant your face smack into SOMEONE&#39;s extremely hairy chest. 

&quot;Whoa, there!&quot; you hear Beau&#39;s voice say, and you feel his big arms come up by reflex to clamp around you and steady you. &quot;How ya doin&#39; there, smol fren?&quot; 

&quot;Beau? The fuck are you doin&#39; here man, I thought you left--&quot; 

hey wait a second. 
He was barechested earlier, just wearing overalls but no shirt underneath and... he //didn&#39;t// have a hairy chest then. 

Your eyes widen and you slowly [[tip your head back-&gt;Parlor Round End]] to stare at him. 
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="81" name="Round Hall Run" tags="RG" position="175,1365" size="100,100">You don&#39;t see the monster, and you don&#39;t hear its footsteps. You DO see the big front doors hanging wide open though. 

Fuck, there&#39;s a little burp welling up in your distended gut. You try to swallow it... 

And you hear the sound of something ceramic, or glass, being broken off in the kitchen somewhere. That&#39;s only a few rooms over. So you&#39;d better think fast and execute your plan. 

First you&#39;re going to slam the front door, making it think you&#39;ve run outside. Before the creature can show up and see you, you&#39;re going to do one of two things: 

Actually [[leave the house-&gt;Round Run Out]] and hide behind something outside-- perhaps one of the porch columns. When it runs past, you sneak back inside and let it spend its hours looking all over the island for you. 

OR

Slam the door and immediately [[run as quietly as possible down the hall-&gt;Round Run Bath]] to duck into one of those side rooms, like the parlor, or that bathroom you saw earlier. The monster&#39;s attention will be focused on the front door and looking for your fleeing figure outside, which it won&#39;t see, because you&#39;ll be INside. 

and once it&#39;s back outside the house you can shut all the doors and just... pretend it doesn&#39;t exist, hopefully. </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="82" name="Round Run Out" tags="RG" position="464,1354" size="100,100">You take a deep breath. If this doesn&#39;t work, you&#39;re dead. You gather your courage and tiptoe outside. Ok. Yeah. One of the columns; not the ones closest to the door, but a few more feet down the porch for a better angle. 

Ok. Ok. Here goes! 

You pull the door shut LOUDLY and quickly scoot behind the porch column you&#39;ve chosen. You barely have time to press yourself up against it, before the front doors-- ohhh THAT&#39;s creepy. That&#39;s creepy as fuck: you expected them to get bashed down by the monster, but no, //it takes the time to open them properly,// like a person, and steps out and closes them behind it. Like... it&#39;s halfway civilized. Shit. 

You don&#39;t see this happen, of course, but you hear it. You hear them open and close. And then the monster dashes off the porch. You hear its loud footsteps thump onto the gravel path leading away from the door. 

You take a deep breath //again,// and peek around the column. Just a little bit. You see the monster as a great dark shape in the moonlight; you see its huge head looking back and forth at the treeline and mansion grounds. Then it stomps off into the night. 

Ok. Ok this is good, right? Ok. Rather than risking opening the front doors again and drawing its attention back to you, you creep sideways, past all the columns, and trot around the house. A rumbly series of belches bubble up from inside you as you head around the house, and your belly starts to shrink back to normal, which is just great news isn&#39;t it? 

You&#39;re now at the back of the house, and you&#39;d thought you remembered seeing the back door hanging open when you first entered the house, and in fact, it is. You can [[head on inside-&gt;Back Doors]] easily enough. 

And yet, off in the distance... you think you see a flickering light. Like a fire, or lantern. What&#39;s going on over there? Is Beau still here, you wonder? Is it worth [[checking out?-&gt;Early Flick Lights]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="83" name="Round Run Bath" tags="RG badend" position="179,1512" size="100,100">You creep over to the front door-- both of them. The one closest to you, on the right side of the house if you&#39;re facing it from outside-- is shut just fine. It&#39;s the other one that&#39;s hanging wide open. So you take a deep breath, then push it shut hard and do an awkward, high-stepping jog away from it down the Hall. 

There&#39;s an alerted growl from the kitchen, and another cracking noise, and some more noises-- it sounds like a few chairs are being tossed aside in the monster&#39;s wake as it hurries to investigate. You keep going. You hear the monster&#39;s pounding footsteps back at the front door. 

And you make the mistake of glancing back at the worst possible time. Because your legs keep moving and you trip over a rug on the ground, a few feet past the main staircase. 

The monster might not have noticed, as it&#39;s already taken a few steps outside by the time this happens, but you land on your gut which is still full of Mammy Vi&#39;s ghost food and out comes this... this utterly atomic **BBBUUUUURRRPP** from your abdomen. Fuck. 

You scramble to your feet and keep moving-- but you hear the monster coming back inside, huffing out nasty, territorial growls in your direction. What the fuck did you do to piss this thing off?? Why&#39;s it here?? What even IS IT, some kinda bear?? You didn&#39;t know there were bears in swamps!!

You see two doors up ahead, both dark inside. You skip the first one, because that&#39;ll be the first place it looks and you&#39;ll have more time to escape by hiding in the second one... and by instinct you shut the door, and you&#39;re gonna have to rely on the fact that it&#39;s an animal too stupid to know what a previously-closed door means. Hopefully it&#39;s not the one that opened the front door in the first place... 

You&#39;re in a bathroom. It&#39;s fairly average sized. There&#39;s a crumbly cracked toilet, a classic claw-footed bathtub, a basin-shaped sink on a pedestal... and holy crap you&#39;re saved, there&#39;s a little circular window up above the toilet you can climb out of! Faint moonlight shines in through it, like the light at the end of a tunnel. 

It&#39;s your only way out of here now. You&#39;re standing on the toilet bowl and opening the window when you hear the monster stop just outside. You shove with all your strength and push the window open, then step up on the back of the toilet and start pulling yourself up. 

You hear a tap on the door and [[start climbing faster!-&gt;Bellystuck Bathroom 1]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="84" name="Backdoor Beau" tags="RG" position="630,597" size="100,100">You walk up to the beautiful backdoors with the stained glass windows set into them, and simply... pull them shut. Easy as that. 

As you turn away though, you hear, and feel, a pretty big THUMP just outside the door... and then there&#39;s a sharp few knocks. 

You can&#39;t see what&#39;s... out there. &quot;Well nah good evenin, smol fren!&quot; you hear Beau&#39;s deep drawl on the other side of the stained glass. It&#39;s too dark to actually distinguish him though. 

&quot;Beau? What are you still...&quot; you open the door and blanch, and... 

&quot;doing... here...&quot; you tilt your head back because you have to look up. 

There is, **and I can&#39;t stress this enough,** a 10 feet tall monster standing just outside the door. It has a huge, thick body built with massive muscles and covered in dark fur. And eyes that gleam in the gloomy night. 

It also has Beau&#39;s voice (though noticeably deeper and growlier), and it has Beau&#39;s accent, and it has Beau&#39;s... overalls. Which are now more like raggedy cut-off jean shorts with some dangly bits. 
&quot;Ayy what&#39;s happenin&#39;, fam?&quot; is what the big fang-toothed jaws say. 

You SLAM THE MOTHERFUCKIN&#39; DOOR SHUT and turn to run. You hear his guffawing, irreverent laughter muffled through the glass. 

Beau&#39;s a... a bigass werewolf or something??!? You run down the hall. Behind you, you hear the door swinging wide open again, and his thunderous footsteps shake the house as he enters. 

&quot;Whassa matter? Why don&#39;t you c&#39;mon over and have a seat on mah lap, smol frien, hawhawhaw!!&quot; he roars, and laughs, and begins to give chase. 

Up ahead, though, is a door under the main stairwell. Just inside that is another stairwell, leading... down. Into a horrible pitch black darkness. You&#39;d never even bother going down there alone, but... you&#39;ve got a monster to hide from! 

You reach the door safely and are exactly two steps down into the darkness, when you realize the loud pounding footsteps of the beast behind you have stopped. You take a small glance back. 

&quot;Listen nah, I&#39;m bein&#39; serious witcha,&quot; huge-monstrous-werewolf-Beau says. One of his gigantic hands comes up, palm towards you, and shakes &#39;no&#39; along with his big werewolfy head. &quot;You go down there, that&#39;s a bad place to be. Might not come back up, ever. Why don&#39;t you stay up here with me instead?&quot; 

The fuck? Like you&#39;re gonna listen to a werewolf that clearly wants to eat you and kill you and leave a bloody mess?!

... are you? 

[[Yeah, NO. Fuck off downstairs away from him.-&gt;BeauFail Reason Base]] 

[[Ok wait... maybe just give him a chance.-&gt;BeauSucc Reason Base]] </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="85" name="Bellystuck Bathroom 1" tags="RG badend" position="37,1509" size="100,100">You wriggle up and pull your chest out. You&#39;re like halfway there, you just gotta... pull yourself... the rest... of the way... 

Oof. That. That doesn&#39;t feel too good. Just... just gotta suck in... take a deep breath, suck your gut in... 

Ohh fuck. OooOHHHH FUCK. &quot;Nonono. No. No!&quot; you rasp out, starting to panic as you push against the sides of the window hard with both arms. You... can&#39;t!? 

You&#39;re... you&#39;re too //big.// You&#39;re stuck. You&#39;re stuck in this fucking window with your ass hanging out the other end. The ghost food in your stomach has blown your waistline up just big enough to get you MOTHERFUCKING STUCK LIKE WINNIE THE POOH. 

The door opens. Loudly. You hear the vast beast sniffing for just a moment and then a very clear, victorious-sounding grunt. 

&quot;No no no no no no no no no no no no no no no--&quot; you sob as you kick your legs out to bat it away. Gigantic paws take hold of your ankles and pull you back through the window. You cling to the outside desperately, but then what feels like a huge //hand// wraps around your chest and shoulder and jerks you back out of the window. 

Now your world is heat and fur and a terrible presence. Hot breaths, puffing against your neck and head. You try to put up a few final struggles, and all you get is... absolutely massive hands, clamping your arms to your sides. 

[[You&#39;ve been caught-&gt;Bellystuck Bathroom 2]] by the beast. 

</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="86" name="Bellystuck Bathroom 2" tags="badend" position="40,1369" size="100,100">By instinct you attempt to turn back to look at the big predator. You only catch a small glimpse of its long fangs and glittering eyes like a dog in the night. 

It lets out some quick little growls as it inspects you, sniffs you, hefts you up. It sounds almost like it&#39;s laughing at you. One of its hands finds your swollen stomach-- currently the bane of your actual existence. It seems mildly curious about that. 

Well, this is it. It&#39;s... gonna bite your head off, or claw you to pieces, and eat everything, so. In those last few moments of clarity, you are filled with a raging fiery desperation: if you&#39;re gonna go out, you&#39;re gonna go out swinging. 

So despite being completely immobilized, you thrash and struggle and flail like a madman. If you can just... kick it in the balls or something, you have the tiniest chance of it dropping you and-- 

Why did it just grab the waistband of your jeans and split it open like a potato chip bag. 

That fire is completely extinguished and you&#39;re left only with the terror once more, but now it&#39;s a confused panic. You barely have time to //think// before the monster bends you over the toilet. 

The fuck?? THE FUCK?!? 
Is this big motherfucker gonna... rr--??!?

Why yes, he is. You scream out loud, high and indignant and utterly offended, as the huge beast [[pushes the tip-&gt;Bellystuck Bathroom 3]] of its member firmly against your asshole. </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="87" name="Bellystuck Bathroom 3" tags="RG badend" position="40,1233" size="100,100">A spurt of warm, slimy precum flushes you out and lubes you up good, allowing him to slide inside much more smoothly. He opens you up wide and his powerful furry arms clamp you tightly against his body. You feel a large, weighty set of throbbing balls press in behind your own. 

He&#39;s all the way inside. 

You expect him to take a long time to get down to business, but this is NOT a loving, passionate romp. This is a straight-up quickie fuck, a rutting. He growls with each hump. You&#39;re so stunned by his actions that you barely feel him back there. Suddenly he squeezes you close and goes stiff all over, and-- BOOSH BOOSH BOOSH BOOSH BWOOSH WOOSH GOOSH SPLOOSH

... there&#39;s about a full minute of that. You squirm and flinch with each pulse of cum. You feel yourself filling up, pressure building, tighter... //bigger, rounder...// shhhit. You let out some indignant sobs and whimpers. 

One of the huge hands rubs your gut, gently, and then the beast pulls out. You hear some cum splattering on the ground between your legs; you&#39;re too numb to really get a sense of how much your ass is leaking. The big hands clasp you around your chest, under your arms, and lift you up and over the edge of the bathtub. 

And just like that, you&#39;re curled up pantsless in the hard dry tub, drooling heat between your legs, listening to the fading footsteps heading down the hallway. You&#39;ve got a... just a terribly fat-looking cum gut now. It&#39;s like a beer gut, but with cum. 

You shiver and cry and pass out, with your arms and legs hugging the sloshy ball your abdomen has been engorged into. 

**END** 

You have been SEEDED by a //Rougarou.// 

The next morning you wake up stiff, sore, achy, and woozy. Nauseous, even. When you manage to gather yourself together, you emerge from the bathroom to an empty house with a draft running front to back, as both sets of doors are open. It looks so peaceful and happy outside in the golden sunlight. 

You are carrying a big round belly in front of you. You can&#39;t button your pants or do your belt, and your shirt simply won&#39;t cover it up, and... fuck, your pants are torn anyway. So... when you waddle over to the boathouse and Beau shows up, there&#39;s no hiding what happened to you from him. He seems sympathetic though, and doesn&#39;t charge you the additional money you originally agreed upon for his services. 

You drive back home and don&#39;t post online for... months, save for a cryptic message about you being &quot;ok&quot; but implying that you&#39;re not. Rumors and speculations abound, but you ignore them, because even though you make an attempt to squeeze the monster&#39;s cum out of you on more than one occasion... your belly stays the same size. 

And then it gets. Bigger. And bigger. It grows and swells and starts to... jostle around... heavier... rounder... tighter. 
You&#39;re fucking pregnant. 
There&#39;s no denying it. The beast impregnated you somehow. 
You know you&#39;re a biological male-- anatomically correct, as it were. So... there&#39;s either weird science, or magic, afoot. Your midriff grows into a vast dome and you look like a woman carrying triplets, except, no boobs. 

You are at least able to seek out scientific and medical help, and while it feels nice to have some smarter people taking care of you... one day the feds approach you with an offer to pay for your, um, &quot;specimen.&quot; 

In fact, they offer to pay for... more &quot;specimens.&quot; 
... but could you really bring yourself to go back there?? And do this... again??!</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="88" name="Round Hide CouchSuccess" tags="RG" position="452,1484" size="100,100">You&#39;re definitely scared, and find it hard to move anyway. But then there&#39;s also the fact that you&#39;re still pretty damn bloated and don&#39;t WANT to move... 

And, you&#39;re being hunted by a predator. Who&#39;s going to be attracted to both motion and sound. And you&#39;re in a quiet abandoned place so ANY movements or noises you make, no matter how small, are going to be amplified... 

So you just hold still, close your eyes, and take steady breaths to keep them as quiet as possible. You can do this. You can absolutely do this. You&#39;ll be fine. 

It&#39;s coming closer. You can see its feet. You can see each sharp, scary claw on each huge toe. It... doesn&#39;t detect you. 

Instead, you suddenly hear the couch creak loudly, and feel it sinking down and your eyes go wide and your body is pressed into the ground. Oh crap, oh crap, oh crap!! You actually let out a grunt as your overstuffed belly is squished under the increasing weight of the monster-- thankfully the couch is creaking so loudly you aren&#39;t heard. 

FUCK. You&#39;re stuck. You&#39;re pinned down by its weight. 

You start to cry quietly when you hear the beast snoring above you, a few minutes later. There&#39;s just nothing you can do now. The big fucker&#39;s fallen asleep and squished you down... if you weren&#39;t so bloated you might be able to move... but shit. 

And then... with the immense pressure squashing your poor tummy, you start to feel a weird roiling, fluttering sensation. 

Oh fuck. Fuckfuckfuck you&#39;re gonna **BUUUUUUURRRRRRRPPPP**. 

That&#39;s it, it&#39;s caught you now. You brace yourself for death. 

...................................... and it continues to snore above you. No fuckin&#39; way. It didn&#39;t wake up?? 

[[You start to wriggle out from under the couch.-&gt;Round Hide CouchSuccess 2]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="89" name="Couch Hide Fail" tags="RG badend" position="169,1222" size="100,100">Carefully you start to wriggle your way out from the back of the couch. Ugh. You just... your recent ghostly stuffing has definitely left you feeling heavier than you should be, and you&#39;re acutely aware of the way your gut presses down and drags against the carpet as you shift your additional weight around. Blech. 

You poke your head out the back of the couch. Ok ok. Doin&#39; good so far. You hear a loud sniff behind you and jerk slightly, but the huge beast seems to still be inspecting something over by the fireplace. You just. Got. To take it slow. And easy. Don&#39;t panic now. Almost there... 

Did you just nudge the sheet with your foot?? Shoot. Hopefully not. You squirm forwards on your full stomach and your chest is free now, and you just. Have. To Suck. It in... 

You let your breath out as quietly as you can, panting. Fuck. Fuck. You&#39;re... you&#39;re bloated and... this is harder than it should be... Just pull some more, and suck. That. Gut. In...!

Shit... shit, shit shit you&#39;re //stuck...// maybe if you just... no, that&#39;s not working, you gotta... maybe wriggle backwards a bit... you feel your shirt roll up and expose more of that fuckin&#39; gut you&#39;ve grown, and then you push forward again and fuck, you just can&#39;t suck it in enough, you&#39;re still too full... 

You jump as you feel a hot puff of breath against the side of your belly. 
And you twist back to look down. 

The gleaming eyes of the monster are staring at you. It&#39;s poked its head under the couch and it&#39;s... grinning. At your predicament. Every single one of its horrific predator teeth are on full display. 

[[And then you feel a massive hand grip your ankle-&gt;Couch Hide Fail 2]] and pull you back and you start screaming for help knowing no one will come. </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="90" name="Couch Hide Fail 2" tags="RG badend" position="171,1096" size="100,100">You claw at the carpet uselessly as the beast drags you out from under the couch. It&#39;s letting these... utterly terrifying short growls out, like it&#39;s... like it&#39;s fucking LAUGHING at you as it grips your body and presses you down face-first on the couch. 

Wait a second... IS THE MONSTER FUCKING LAUGHING AT YOU??!?

&quot;Well nah,&quot; it says, and you&#39;re stunned to hear a familiar voice emanating from its maw. &quot;Heheh. Caught me a nice, //plump// lil fish didn&#39;t I?&quot; One of his big hands pats your swollen belly a few times. 

&quot;... //Beau??//&quot; you rasp out. 

&quot;Heh! Heheh. What gave it away? The overalls?&quot; The huge werewolf looms over you. You see that he is, in fact, wearing a tattered pair of overalls, with the straps undone over his massive furry torso. &quot;Shoo! If I didn&#39;t know bettah, I&#39;d guess some OTHER beast pumped a baby or two in ya,&quot; and he gestured toward your bloated belly. &quot;Did Mammy Vi do this to ya?&quot; 

&quot;You&#39;re a werewolf??&quot; you squeak. 

&quot;Well. Technically yes, but...&quot; he grins down at you, showing every single one of his fangs. &quot;Down HEAH in CAJUN country, we call &#39;em //Le Rougarou.//&quot; He shrugs and chuckles. &quot;O&#39;course, it mean pretty much the same thing nah, but hey.&quot; 

His vast hands gently encircle your body. You&#39;re completely at his mercy now. Your only defense against any foul intentions, is your wits and your voice. And the fact that there&#39;ll be video evidence. You swallow hard. &quot;I&#39;m recording you, by the way. Livestreaming this. I managed to get... a few bars. Everyone&#39;s gonna see you kill--&quot; 

It&#39;s a lie, and it&#39;s all you&#39;ve got... and he doesn&#39;t fall for it. 

&quot;Hmm... //live//streamin, eh?&quot; Beau clutches you in his left hand-- squeezing your belly uncomfortably as he lifts you up like a toy. His other hand rubs his whiskered chin. You see nasty looking claws on his fingertips. &quot;Fuckin&#39; for an audience... That&#39;s kinda hot, not gonna lie. Never thought to do that before.&quot; 

&quot;... fuckin&#39;... wha--?&quot; you frown. That seems to be an odd response. Doesn&#39;t he... want to kill you?? Isn&#39;t that what werewolves do?? 

And then you realize that he&#39;s got... TWO long dark floppy things dangling down there. One in the back, which is actually his bushy werew--rougarou tail. And uhh... 

Well shucks, that&#39;s a penis. Just. On full display. His overalls are split at the seams between the legs; it looks like they couldn&#39;t handle the mass of his thighs as he turned into his beast-form. 

Beau smiles when he realizes you&#39;re staring. Within a second, it rises to full attention, pointing directly at your face. &quot;Don&#39;t worry, smol fren. I will be... pretty gentle with you.&quot; 

[[Uh-oh.-&gt;Beau Bloat Badend 2]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="91" name="Round Hide CouchSuccess 2" tags="RG" position="599,1492" size="100,100">You are... thinner now? That loud belch must&#39;ve shrunk your gut some. You&#39;ll check it out in a minute once you&#39;re free. You keep your movements steady and controlled; you don&#39;t want to jostle the couch above you and wake the beast up. 

You&#39;re able to scoot out the back. You feel more gas welling up inside you. Fuck fuck fuck, it&#39;s like, right in your chest. Ready to come out. Kinda hurts, like a cramp. 

Is that all ghost food is, anyway? Just... air? Buhh. Hopefully you don&#39;t get sick or something. Musty old, ghost-ass air... 

You creep away from the couch. In the inky darkness you can see an even darker huge shape positively ABUSING the old couch with the immense weight of such a huge monster... 

You glance down at yourself. Hey, you&#39;re... pretty much back to normal! A little round still, but... &quot;half a pizza&quot; round instead of &quot;two pizzas&quot; round. Another belch or so might see you back to your old flat self again. Of course you don&#39;t want to risk making any more noise and waking that big fucker up... So you back out slowly, and then turn and head [[for the stairs.-&gt;Upstairs Landing]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="92" name="Back Doors" tags="" position="874,1393" size="100,100">You head back inside through the plantation home&#39;s lovely stained-glass back doors. You can see the front door, still closed, all the way at the end of the hall. The house is really &quot;deep,&quot; that is, it&#39;s a good bit of a walk all the way down to the front. 

You pull your phone out and record. &quot;Holy shit you guys. Ok. I&#39;m back in the house, I... shit. If I can get a picture or video of the THING I just escaped from, I&#39;ll try, but I&#39;m not gonna risk my life. Just. Take my word for it. There&#39;s some //crazy shit// at this house.&quot; You keep your phone on and head forwards. 

You&#39;ve pretty much seen everything on this floor, haven&#39;t you? 

There&#39;s a staircase leading DOWN, up ahead. You... didn&#39;t see this one earlier, did you? Well maybe you didn&#39;t realize it was here-- it&#39;s right underneath the MAIN stairway, leading into a basement. 

... how the hell does a home in the middle of a SWAMP have a basement?? You should totally [[head down there-&gt;Back to Downstairs]] and check it out.

Of course, now that the monster&#39;s out of the house, no matter how creaky the stairs leading up are, you probably won&#39;t attract any unwanted attention by [[heading upstairs.-&gt;Upstairs Landing]] </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="93" name="Early Flick Lights" tags="" position="603,1367" size="100,100">Shit. What could that be? From where you are now, it looks like... hmm. It&#39;s just a faint glow, flickering, twinkling almost. Could be a small campfire? Slightly yellowy... 

Wait, there&#39;s //two// sources of light, aren&#39;t there? Where&#39;d that second one come from? 

To the left, far in the distance, it looks like someone&#39;s lighting a fire. Repeatedly. Across the way, to the right, it looks like someone&#39;s already //lit// a fire. 

You definitely don&#39;t want to risk going out there right now though. Not while that big fucker&#39;s running around out here. And you worked so hard to lure him out! 

[[So you head back inside.-&gt;Back Doors]] </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="94" name="Back to Downstairs" tags="" position="1044,730" size="100,100">You step up to the cracked doorway and get a quick recording of the unnerving abyss before you. The stairs just seem to disappear at the bottom. A MAJOR part of you loves the thrill... normally. Your more logical side is protesting loudly though, after your earlier run-ins. 

&quot;Ok guys,&quot; you say, voice high and shaking with anticipation. &quot;So here&#39;s this creepy-ass staircase, and... I don&#39;t know if you all know much about this area, but a lot of homes down South? They don&#39;t do the basement thing. Because of flooding and just... swamplands and yeah. So this should be interesting. Let&#39;s go check it out.&quot; 

And you [[start walking down-&gt;The Basement]] the stairs. </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="95" name="Parlor Round End" tags="RG end" position="596,1260" size="100,100">Beau&#39;s face is not human. His BODY. Is not human. He is a hulking great monstrous BEAST, covered in soft shaggy fur, with eyes that gleam in the darkness like a raccoon and large sharp teeth in a grinning snout. 

And you. Have just... walked right into him. Just like that, yeah. There&#39;s not even a chance to escape now-- you can feel how vast and powerful his limbs are, hairy and bulging with thick muscles. He could probably stuff you whole down his throat, into his large body, and have room for seconds. 

You quiver. He&#39;s got you and he&#39;s going to do whatever he wants to you and your arms aren&#39;t even free to attempt to poke him in the eye or anything. 

&quot;Aww, you&#39;s all scared o&#39;me, like, c&#39;mon nah.&quot; His voice is deeper and gruffer than ever before but it&#39;s him alright. &quot;You ain&#39;t gotta shake like that. I ain&#39;t gonna hurtcha.&quot; 

&quot;... oh yeah?&quot; you say in a high, frightened voice. &quot;Then, uhh, why&#39;ve you been chasing me??&quot; 

&quot;Mmm, if I wanted to //kill// you,&quot; Beau says, squeezing you a little bit just to show off his immense power, &quot;you&#39;d be dead already boy.&quot; 

&quot;Then what do you want??&quot; 

&quot;Well uhh...&quot; Beau smirks down at you. 

&quot;What the hell are you anyway? Some kinda werewolf??&quot; 

&quot;Oh. Oh this?&quot; Beau puffs his chest up a bit. &quot;I&#39;m what they call roun&#39; here, a //Rougarou,// but uhh... basically yeah. It&#39;s the same thing, for the most part, with a few smol differences, but yeah.&quot; 

Suddenly you&#39;re hefted up onto his shoulder, in the classic, demeaning, &#39;kidnap my helpless victim&#39; pose. &quot;Here, nah, you come with me, I&#39;ll tell ya some stories and we gon&#39; have some fun. I get lonely up in here sometimes.&quot; 

[[He carries you upstairs.-&gt;Parlor Round End 1]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="96" name="Parlor Round End 1" tags="end RG" position="725,1264" size="100,100">He climbs the stairs quickly and carries you into a bedroom. You&#39;re dropped onto a bed, where you bounce at least once. &quot;Mm. If I didn&#39;t know better I&#39;d say you was pregnant,&quot; Beau chuckles when he gets a good look at you. 

You frown. &quot;I&#39;m a //dude.//&quot; 

Beau starts laughing harder. &quot;Hehehheh!! Ha. HAHAHA. Hawhawhaw. Haw...&quot; He reaches over and flicks a light. &quot;But knowin&#39; Mammy down in the kitchen, uhh... I suppose you been eatin&#39; some-uh her tasty cookin&#39; nah.&quot; 

&quot;I... yeah, I met the ghost down there-- this place has power?? What, you got a generator?&quot; you raise an eyebrow at the old lamp by the bed, which casts amber-hued light into the room. 

&quot;Oh yeah, I only turn it on at night &#39;cuz-- HEY,&quot; Beau roars, suddenly. He charges the bed and you jump back and yelp, but he&#39;s not aiming at you. He swings his hands in the air on the other side of the bed, like he&#39;s trying to drive some insects away from a picnic. &quot;You get yo&#39; scrawny rebel ass away! This here&#39;s MY lil&#39; buddy, not yours!!&quot; 

&quot;The fuck??&quot; you ask, completely bewildered now. You don&#39;t see anything where he was attacking, except maybe some extra little clouds of dust. 

Beau... sighs, and scoops you up, sits on the bed, and then sits you between his legs, in his lap basically. His gigantic arms wrap around you and cuddle you close. It&#39;s not unpleasant but you feel a very ominous mix of &#39;oh thank you I&#39;m flattered this is nice&#39; and [[&#39;dude uhh what are you doing and why.&#39;-&gt;Parlor Round End 2]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="97" name="Parlor Round End 2" tags="end RG" position="726,1144" size="100,100">&quot;So back durin&#39; the war,&quot; Beau says, as one of his hands rubs your bloated belly, &quot;the son of--&quot; 

&quot;Civil War?&quot; you ask. You&#39;re blushing. Fuck, his... you don&#39;t wanna admit it but his hand feels //good,// all big and warm and strong, giving you tummy rubs... nice and soothing... fuck fuck fuck you shouldn&#39;t be enjoying this but you are. 

&quot;Yeah, Civil War,&quot; Beau says. &quot;That ghost there, I shooed him off. He was the only son, of the man who owned this plantation. He goes off to war, see, and gets killed. And it was a heroic death, too-- killed a lotta Yankee boys and distracted them all, while his little squad of rebels was able to retreat without him.&quot; 

Beau sniffs the air. He growls over in the corner of the room. &quot;I mean it nah, Jefferson, this one&#39;s mine, you back the fuck off, y&#39;hear??&quot; 

&quot;He&#39;s still here?&quot; you ask. &quot;He&#39;s... is he invisible??&quot; 

&quot;Yeah but I&#39;m a Rougarou lil buddy. I can tell when ghosts is around just like any ol&#39; dog can. Smell &#39;im, too.&quot; Beau hefts you up closer and sits you atop his enormous thighs. Your head&#39;s got no place to go but right between the mountainous furry pecs on either side of your face. 

&quot;Anywho, his pappy sorta fell in love with one of his slaves,&quot; Beau continues. &quot;That&#39;s Mammy Vi. He left her the entire property in his will.&quot; A big finger of his reaches down under your belly and rubs your crotch for a sec. FUCK. FUck. FUCK. NO. He&#39;s got you horny but you can&#39;t help it-- 

&quot;And the poor boy didn&#39;t produce no heirs, on account o&#39; dyin&#39; so young,&quot; Beau says. &quot;So... despite dyin&#39; a hero&#39;s death, I guess his &#39;honor&#39; got all fucked up and he came back to haunt or somethin&#39;... I dunno why ghosts come back. But they do. And he haunts this upper floor of the mansion every night, lookin&#39; for someone to... impregnate.&quot; 

You go very still as you feel the unmistakable feeling of a very large pecker, stiffening, and rising up along your back. &quot;An&#39; he&#39;s so ashamed of himself and his family, that he can&#39;t even show his ghostly-ass. So he&#39;s invisible. He&#39;ll grab you and start fuckin&#39; your pussy or your ass or whatever you got, and try to knock you up. And you can&#39;t even see it happening, you just feel it.&quot; 

You cringe. &quot;Uhh. Hey, uh. So. How do I... I mean, how does one... prevent. Him from doing so.&quot; 

&quot;Well obviously,&quot; Beau says, and his fingers trace circles around your chest and full tummy. &quot;If you already pregnant? He can&#39;t do shit.&quot; 

You whimper as Beau reaches under your shirt and [[starts to pull it off.-&gt;Parlor Round End 3]] </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="98" name="Parlor Round End 3" tags="RG end" position="860,1144" size="100,100">&quot;Please please please no--&quot; 

&quot;Shhhhh,&quot; Beau croons in your ear as he undresses you. &quot;Shhh. I&#39;mma claim you for myself, but I&#39;ll make you feel //good.// Jefferson over there. He don&#39;t care if you feel good, he just wants to get his rocks off.&quot; 

&quot;I, uhh, what if we just, you know, LEFT, without ANYONE fucking me, right??&quot; you say. &quot;I mean--&quot; 

&quot;Shhhh. It&#39;s alright. It&#39;s alright. Shhh.&quot; Beau hefts you up and tugs your jeans off; they slide down to your ankles. &quot;Shhhh. I&#39;mma make you a promise. You gonna cum, SO HARD, you pass out and sleep like a lil baby all night. Ok? And I&#39;ll sleep here witchya, and ain&#39;t no dumb ghosts gonna bother ya. I guaran-TEE.&quot; 

You squirm and whimper and cry as you feel Beau&#39;s huge slippery cock start to invade you. It&#39;s fat and firm and... slides in... aided by gravity, of course. It feels like he&#39;s just impaling you, straight-up. 

&quot;Shhh. Shhh.&quot; Beau&#39;s warm, powerful hands rub your front, all over. &quot;Just a lil more, there we go. You&#39;re doin&#39; good. I just got. To find. Your special lil spot.&quot; 

&quot;Idon&#39;thaveaspecialspot,&quot; you squeak out. &quot;Idon&#39;tIdon&#39;tIdon&#39;t have one--&quot; 

&quot;You sure do,&quot; Beau murmurs. He cuddles you and hugs you tight to his body as he hilts inside you. &quot;You just never had it touched yet. So you don&#39;t know about it.&quot; 

And before you can say anything else, any further words of protest, Beau&#39;s shaft nudges... a spot. A point. Deep in your bowels. 

[[Your brain goes utterly blank-&gt;Parlor Round End 4]] and your own pecker goes rock. Fucking. Hard. </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="99" name="Parlor Round End 4" tags="RG end" position="867,1263" size="100,100">&quot;How&#39;s that?&quot; Beau mumbles in your ear. 

&quot;Mmm??&quot; you moan. 

&quot;You ever felt that? You ever been. Fucked. Like that?&quot; he grinds into you and your body explodes with pleasure. 

&quot;Unnggghhh!!&quot; you wail, your eyes rolling back in your head. 

&quot;Are you ready to get knocked up?&quot; Beau asks. 

&quot;MMnnnMMmmmmNnnn??&quot; 

&quot;Are you ready. For me. To //breed. You.//&quot; 

You melt into the big beautiful arms holding you and start to pass out at the sight of your swollen belly starting to grow, bigger and bigger, rounder, tighter... 

**END** 

You wake up cuddled tight in Beau&#39;s mighty arms, tummy still churning with a massive load of cum. You smile down at it like you&#39;ve been doped. Goodness. What. A stud. 

When Beau wakes up, he inspects your abdomen, hollers in triumph, and then suddenly starts to shrink and revert to his original human self you first met him in. Apparently... he wasn&#39;t joking about you getting pregnant. His rougarou form seems to go into a regular rutting period where he can just about impregnate whoever he wants... and you&#39;re it this time. So... great. 

Shit. You don&#39;t even mind. If getting fucked like that... if it feels that good, you might have to do it more often. Hot Damn. 

Beau&#39;s real kind to you as well. First he helps you get cleaned up-- he&#39;s got a shack hidden in some trees on the island, with a generator and a shitty shower, and since you&#39;re pregnant with one of his pups, you don&#39;t need ALL that cum up in there... 
He explains some things to you, shows you around the plantation and grounds in the lovely morning, tells you about the ghosts and other residents of the bayou... brings you some breakfast... and takes you back across the swamp to your car. He just lets you go, just like that. &quot;Just c&#39;mon back in about... a month or so.&quot; 

When you get back home, you go dark on the Internet for a few days. You need some time to recuperate and mentally process everything. It&#39;s not long before you notice you&#39;re getting a little belly, just... a pudgy little gut. 

It doesn&#39;t stay little for long. 
Shit. You don&#39;t even mind. You grow, and bloat, and swell, and distend, and you just shrug it off and let people think you&#39;re putting on weight. After a month passes, you&#39;re HUGE and full-term and can feel the thing playing and kicking inside your tight, massive gut. 

Eventually you get in touch with Beau again, who meets you at your place and is happy to help you give birth to a cute little creepy rougarou pup. It... comes out the same way it got in, which isn&#39;t as torturous as it might sound but is definitely uncomfortable. And Beau is just, he&#39;s a... well. You&#39;ve thought about it a lot and... you kinda wanna... do it again. 

So you do. </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="100" name="Parlor" tags="RG" position="1799,198" size="100,100">You&#39;re actually not sure if this place truly qualifies as a &#39;parlor,&#39; but it&#39;s a fancy old-school word, and you&#39;ve already designated that first room the &#39;living room,&#39; so... parlor it is. It&#39;s got like, cute little round tables, almost cafe-style. You can imagine people sitting down to drink tea with each other in here. There&#39;s at least one big roll-top desk, and another-- this one has a desiccated spindly thing atop it that looks like it used to be a feather pen, forever embedded in a little pot filled with congealed ink. 

You start to get some pictures and maybe a few seconds of video, but you hear something... 

It sounds like one of the doors just opened. The front, or the back. Leading outside. You&#39;re not sure. Fuck. Which... shit! Someone else is here?? Or is it... possibly, some ghostly activity? You&#39;re both nervous and excited. 

Perhaps you should [[take a peek out-&gt;Corner Peek Parlor]] into the hallway and see what&#39;s made that noise. If it&#39;s something paranormal, that&#39;s //literally// what you&#39;re here for. 

And yet, discretion being the better part of valor... you might consider doubling back, or even hiding, just in case of potential threats. That [[closet over there has a slatted door-&gt;Parlor Closet Hide]] you can peek out from, if you hide inside. You&#39;ll be able to come out when the coast is clear. 

... Maybe you should just [[double back to the living room-&gt;Par to LivRoom Normal]] though. </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="101" name="Corner Peek Parlor" tags="RG" position="1927,421" size="100,100">You take a deep breath, biting your lip for a second. This could be it. You could FINALLY discover actual ghosts-- just about every other expedition you&#39;ve made has had some sort of logical explanation so far. Like... hoaxes, //Scooby-Doo// bullshit, natural phenomena explainable by scientists... You wanna see the REAL shit. 

And this. Could be it. 

You&#39;ve got your back to the wall, just on the side of the threshold. You&#39;ve got your phone ready to capture. 

You swing out around the door-- OH SHIT OH SHIT WHAT THE FUCK IS THAT THING IT&#39;S GOT HUGE TEETH ITS EYES ARE FUCKING GLOWING

[[YOU JUMP BACK INTO THE ROOM HOLY SHIT-&gt;ParlorFuckUp]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="102" name="Parlor Closet Hide" tags="" position="1802,328" size="100,100">Shoot. As you open the closet door and pull it shut in front of you, you suddenly feel... really dumb. There&#39;s nothing in here! You&#39;re alone on this island in the middle of the swamp, and... and hey. If there&#39;s actually ghosts hanging around, they sure aren&#39;t worried about a closet door, are they? 

Still, you&#39;ve played enough video games to know that the first step in not being seen, is... not being seen. No line of sight? Good start. So now you just hold still and steady your breaths and try not to grin too wide with the thrill of it-- 

Very loud, heavy, thumping footsteps come pounding up the hallway, closer, closer... hoo boy this is it, there&#39;s some kinda presence here isn&#39;t there, you&#39;re about to see a real-- 

WHAT THE FUCK IS THAT???

The smile falls off your face instantly and you freeze; your eyes bug out of your skull in abject terror. Something monstrous and huge and furry just stepped into the room with you. You can&#39;t get a good enough look at it because it&#39;s so damn BIG, but it&#39;s definitely... not human, and it moves too smoothly to be some kind of costumed hoax... right?? Shit shit shit. What are you gonna do now? 

You watch it walk right past your hiding spot. You can hear it sniffing a little. This is both good news and bad news. Good news is, it&#39;ll probably pick up your scent and follow your steps back, maybe even out of the house. 

The bad news, of course, is that //it&#39;s picking up your scent.// 

It moves into the next room. Staying here is NOT an option; if you stay here too long it&#39;ll end up following your scent right to this very closet and then... yeah. Not good. 

You shiver. This is... this is gonna suck. Ok. You just... stay calm, right? It&#39;s probably just a big... no, it&#39;s not a fucking DOG, it&#39;s... It doesn&#39;t matter. You&#39;re gonna sneak out and find a new hiding spot. 

You push the closet door open VERY slowly, listening for any creaking noises. It&#39;s silent... you just need... to squeeze out. 

//cccrrreeeeeaaaakkkk....// 

FUCK. 
You sprint for the [[open arch to the hallway,-&gt;Closet Run]] and you can hear the beast&#39;s alerted growl just in the other room... </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="103" name="Par to LivRoom Normal" tags="" position="1696,326" size="100,100">You decive to back away, returning to the living room. It&#39;s a good thing, too, because you hear some BIG foosteps arrive down the hall. Whatever&#39;s making them probably outweighs you more than double. 
It COULD be a ghost making noise, sure. And that&#39;s definitely what you&#39;re here to record. But. You&#39;re a bit, shall we say, &#39;shooketh.&#39; 

Especially when you hear that deep growl just outside the room, somewhere in the main hall. You&#39;re here for ghosts, yeah... but THAT ain&#39;t no ghost. It&#39;s pretty loud and you freeze with a primal fear. Something-- a large animal perhaps, like a bear-- has just entered the mansion with you. And it&#39;s on this floor. And these old rooms have a lot of damaged, missing, worn-down doors that you WON&#39;T be able to hide behind for long if it notices you and decides to give chase. 

A few slow, heavy footsteps thump down on the hardwood flooring of the hall, clicking on occasion with the sound of claws... they stop for a moment. 

Fuck, you can hear it... //sniffing.// It sounds like some huge dog or something. Your eyes are accustomed to the dark by now but it&#39;s SO dark you&#39;re still blind beyond a certain distance. Everything is shadows and shapes and blackness. 

Maybe you can... wait here. Maybe it&#39;ll move on. If you just relax and [[pretend you&#39;re not here...-&gt;Stealth Living Room]]

Or, you could fuckin&#39; MOVE, but you&#39;ll almost certainly either be seen or heard. If you can&#39;t find a good escape route, or a weapon of some sort, well... that&#39;s gonna suck. 
So do you want to risk [[moving?-&gt;Normal RG Run]] </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="104" name="ParlorFuckUp" tags="RG" position="2061,425" size="100,100">You slip on a rug and fall backwards, banging your elbow on the ground. Your phone flies out of your hand, somewhere behind you. 

Advancing into the room is an enormous, furry beast, built thick like a bear or a gorilla, but with a more wolf-like face... great big teeth, massive limbs bulging with muscles as thick around as your body. 

Some kinda werewolf!? It stomps into the room, drooling, //grinning// down at you as you scramble backwards. It&#39;s like the floor turned to ice; you can&#39;t seem to fucking find a foothold and keep slipping backwards in your panic. 

You-- 

[[roll over and get to your feet-&gt;ParlorFuck Roll]] so you can run away. 

[[grab one of the small tables and throw it-&gt;ParlorFuck Throw]] at the monster to distract it. </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="105" name="ParlorFuck Roll" tags="RG" position="1928,298" size="100,100">You roll sideways and try to get to your feet-- 

and before you&#39;ve even straightened your legs out, you feel a gigantic hand slam into your back and smash you into the floor, crushing the breath out of your lungs. 

[[It&#39;s right on top of you.-&gt;ParlorFuck RollFail]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="106" name="ParlorFuck Throw" tags="RG" position="2066,293" size="100,100">You reach for one of the little tea tables and fling it at the approaching creature. 

The werewolf-monster-thing just... bats it aside and 

&quot;HAWHAWHAWHAWHAWHAWHAW&quot; starts LAUGHING

//it&#39;s laughing at you??!?// 

It&#39;s motherfucking laughing at you! 

[[And it&#39;s still coming.-&gt;ParlorFuck ThrowFail]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="107" name="ParlorFuck ThrowFail" tags="RG badend" position="2056,174" size="100,100">Before you can grab any other improvised weapons, you see the beast coil itself, pounce, and slam you down under its weight. The impact shakes the entire mansion. You&#39;re stunned, vision darkening for just a second, and then it has you pinned and helpless on your back. 

&quot;Let&#39;s just not waste any more time, nah, we both know how this is gonna end,&quot; the monster says. In Beau&#39;s accent, and a deeper, rougher version of his voice. 

The FUCK?? &quot;Beau??!?&quot; you yelp. &quot;You&#39;re a werewolf??&quot; 

&quot;//Rougarou,// ma cher,&quot; he says, and suddenly he buries his snout between your legs and takes a long breath. &quot;Mmm. Same thing, I mean yeah. But got to respect culture.&quot; 

&quot;... what are you gonna do?&quot; you whimper. His huge hand presses into your chest; it&#39;s all he needs to hold you down. You&#39;re completely at his mercy. 

&quot;Hmm. Well. I //COULD// eat you. I could. Maybe I should.&quot; He licks his chops above your face. 

You swallow, and blink tears out, and breathe deep so you can stare up into his face as firm and dignified as you can. &quot;... make it quick, then,&quot; you whisper, your entire body starting to violently tremble. 

Beau looms over you. You feel him... rub... his body on you-- no he&#39;s //dry-humping// you. What the fuck?? 

Your eyes go wide. Ohh holy shit please no. 

&quot;But what I&#39;d like to do instead,&quot; Beau grunts, &quot;is to fill. Your smol lil belly. With. Lots. Of babies.&quot; He punctuates his phrases with long, grinding thrusts of HOOOO FUCK THAT IS A HUGE DICK slobbering pre all over your chest and belly, fuck it&#39;s like poking your face ever third hump or so...

&quot;... what are you gonna do?&quot; you whimper. He still hasn&#39;t let you up; his huge hand is all he needs to hold you down. You&#39;re completely at his mercy. 

&quot;Hmm. Well. I //COULD// eat you. I could. Maybe I should.&quot; 

You are able to fold your arms in front of your head, and bury your face in them. &quot;... make it quick, then,&quot; you whisper, your entire body starting to violently tremble. 

Beau looms over you. You feel him... rub... his body on you-- no he&#39;s //dry-humping// you. What the fuck??

&quot;But what I&#39;d like to do instead,&quot; Beau grunts, &quot;is to fill. Your smol lil belly. With. Lots. Of babies.&quot; He punctuates his phrases with humps against your rear and back. 

You cringe and start to look back at him; nonononono he&#39;s tugging at your pants!!!

You&#39;ve got to run as fast as you can before that //thing// catches up to you! 

You&#39;re in the hallway and you&#39;ve only got two directions to run: 

Back to the end of the hall! The back doors are hanging open, you can [[run out and shut them,-&gt;RG Chase from ParClo Fail]] which should slow the thing down temporarily and give you time to get out of sight! 

Up ahead is a dark doorway and just inside is a staircase leading down into a cellar or basement or something it looks spooky but it also looks like [[a good place to hide!-&gt;RG Chase into Base]]

Or you could just skip those stairs! Run right past them and [[head for the mansion&#39;s main staircase,-&gt;RG Chase from ParClo Fail]] there&#39;s bound to be plenty of rooms to hide in! </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="110" name="RG Chase into Base" tags="RG" position="1432,678" size="100,100">Fuck fuck FUCK IT&#39;S RIGHT BEHIND YOU

You jump down and almost fall down the stairs but somehow keep your footing and just like that, you&#39;re at the bottom of the stairs. 

You keep sprinting ahead, into the darkness, not even caring if you run into anything. It seems... empty down here. 

You skid to a halt. You realize... it&#39;s not following you? 

Then where... you crouch, panting hard, and stare back at the stairwell. 

You can&#39;t exactly see all the, um. Details. But there&#39;s a big lupine head and huge hands tipped with claws, and eyes that may or may not be staring straight at you... it looks like a bear, or... or a REALLY humanoid fucking huge dog...

or wolf... 

It growls, and, uhh... retreats. Like it sniffed the stairs for a moment, then just... pulled away and disappeared into the house above. 

The fuck? 

Well, you&#39;re in [[the basement,-&gt;The Basement]] now, aren&#39;t you. </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="111" name="RG Chase from ParClo Fail" tags="RG badend" position="2064,558" size="100,100">Fuck, it&#39;s RIGHT THERE, you just have to outrun it... not long, just long enough! You make the hardwood flooring positively squeak with your fast feet, and you can hear the thumping stomps of the huge monster coming after you, but if you can just-- maybe-- 

You scream when you feel a gigantic hand grip your shoulder and jerk you back, painfully, and it pulls so hard it sends you flying backwards on your ass. You scoot for a good ten feet or so on the smooth floor. Then you attempt to right yourself and face the animal; you&#39;re not sure whether your last emotions are going to be intense fear or fiery fury. 

It doesn&#39;t quite let you get to your feet, looming over you, three, //four// times your size perhaps... an absolute beast. Utterly huge, like, it seems to fill the hallway. It&#39;s got to be between 9 and 12 feet tall... it&#39;s a little hard to tell with it clamping a single hand around your body and forcing you to stay down on your knees. 

You swallow, and struggle, and glare up at the beast with tears streaking down your face. &quot;GO ON, FUCKER,&quot; you yell as it raises a huge hand up in the air. &quot;GO ON DO IT!!&quot; 

The hand descends. You close your eyes and prepare to feel nothing else. 

... you feel your hair being ruffled up. By the same hand that was just being poised to knock your head flying. 

&quot;Heh heh heh. Haw haw. You pretty brave, boy,&quot; says the monster. 

You blanch. Even as you feel your entire body being lifted up, feet off the ground, to be at the creature&#39;s eye level... you&#39;re more shocked than scared at this point. &quot;... //Beau//?!?&quot; you gasp. 

&quot;Howdy-do, smol fren,&quot; says the beast, and it grins and shows you all of its fangs. His. Fangs. The FUCK. 

Well apparently Beau&#39;s a werewolf, a big fucking werewolf, ain&#39;t that great. At least he doesn&#39;t seem to want to kill you; he&#39;d have done that already... [[So what does he want?-&gt;RG Hall PooMammyFuck]] </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="112" name="RG Hall PooMammyFuck" tags="RG badend" position="2051,688" size="100,100">&quot;... so what, what is this? You&#39;re like a werewolf thing?&quot; 

&quot;I, smol fren,&quot; Beau says as he puffs his huge chest up even bigger, &quot;am a //rougarou.//&quot; 

&quot;... what&#39;s that.&quot; 

&quot;Well, uuuhh...&quot; He shrugs. His shoulders are like big furry cannonballs. &quot;Yes.&quot; 

&quot;Yes what?&quot; 

&quot;Yes, I am a werewolf-thing, but see down here, we calls &#39;em //le rougarou//, &#39;cuz you know. French Cajun culture and all that good shit.&quot; 

&quot;So you&#39;re not like a savage slasher killer eat-my-liver, uh, monster?&quot; 

&quot;Heheh. Heh.&quot; Beau buries his snout in your abdomen for a minute and sniffs-- it kinda tickles. &quot;If I was gonna eatcha, I&#39;d eat ALL o&#39;ya. Why let the rest go to waste, hawhaw.&quot; 

&quot;And is there any reason why you didn&#39;t wanna just. Tell me? You were a werewolf?&quot; you ask. &quot;I mean yeah I can think of some good reasons, but I&#39;m a paranormal investigator... um, Internet. Personality. Not like, a fed, or a cop or something.&quot; 

&quot;Well that&#39;s almost worse,&quot; Beau mutters. He flips you around and you twitch as he sniffs your ass, poking his nose around between your legs. Must be a werewolf thing. &quot;You put me on the Internet and then EVERYONE knows... although... I bet there&#39;s tons a&#39;people out there what might be findin&#39; myself mighty sexy though... hmm.&quot; 

You&#39;re starting to feel a little nervous again, but this time it&#39;s the &#39;creepy&#39; kinda nervous, not the &#39;OMG IM GONNA DIE&#39; nervous. Why&#39;s he so... [[touchy-feely-&gt;PooMammyFuck 1]] all of a sudden?? </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="113" name="PooMammyFuck 1" tags="badend RG" position="2183,687" size="100,100">&quot;Hmm.&quot; Beau sniffs you some more, then flips you over on your back and holds you in his hand. He&#39;s in complete control; you&#39;re like a doll to him. You notice he&#39;s still wearing his overalls from earlier, though they don&#39;t fit at all and look to be in very poor condition from all his extra bulk. 

He is THICK, too. This isn&#39;t a scrawny, gangly, rubber-mask werewolf before you. He&#39;s built wide like a bear or a great ape, with immense power on display every time he so much as moves a finger. His hand feels like... a harness, or a chair you&#39;ve slumped down in. 

Beau pokes your stomach with one finger; he&#39;s careful not to jab too hard but you do feel his claw. &quot;How&#39;s about I show you some proper, umm, Southern Hospitality (tm)?&quot; 

You wriggle in his grip. He holds you quite neatly in one hand. &quot;Uh. What. Might that. Entail. Dinner and a movie??&quot; 

&quot;Well, I was thinkin&#39;... it&#39;d be nice to //impregnate your bell-eh,//&quot; he chuckles. His werewolf snout noses up under your shirt and he //LICKS// your abdomen all the way up to your neck. His head comes out right in your face, out the neck hole of your shirt, and then he pulls himself back free. 

This utterly wrecks your t-shirt. It falls apart in tatters, baring your torso. You shiver. &quot;Uh. Well. Not to insinuate anything, but, you know. I happen to be. In possession of male anatomy. Therefore, uhh. Impregnation is really not on the table.&quot; 

Beau scoffs, a hot blast of air on your bare chest. &quot;Look here, smol fren.&quot; He shifts your weight, and flexes his free arm in front of you. You see an enormous muscle pump up-- it&#39;s got to be close to the size of your average car tire, at least in diameter from where you&#39;re looking. 

&quot;You see that?&quot; Beau asks, making sure to flex up and down a few times. &quot;Here, look.&quot; He clamps you against his chest, burying your face in the obnoxious, arrogant mountains of fur-coated pectoral muscles. &quot;Lemme ask you. In the face of a studly specimen such as myself. How you think you AIN&#39;T gonna get pregnant?&quot; 

[[&quot;Because I&#39;m a DUDE??!&quot;-&gt;PooMammyFuck 2]] </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="114" name="PooMammyFuck 2" tags="RG badend" position="2191,553" size="100,100">&quot;Yeah, you sure are a dude,&quot; Beau snickers. &quot;So am I though. A dude who&#39;s at least 10 times &#39;dude-lier&#39; than you is, smol fren. Here. Here look.&quot; 

FUCK he pulls you straight into his crotch; you feel a great big heavy schlong flop onto your back and your face ends up buried in his ballsack. His shredded pants are wide open down here, full exposure. 

You cringe. It... it&#39;s a seriously heady musk, clouding your senses, and you can feel those massive balls positively throbbing. Like they&#39;re boiling over. Shit, they feel like they&#39;re bigger around than your head. 

&quot;You feel those big dogs? They ready to //breeeeeed,// I guaran-TEE.&quot; Beau drops you for a second and you back away quick, doing a little crab walk. He doesn&#39;t even try to stop you, he just grins. &quot;They need to be emptied. Preferably INTO someone. And here, you, are!&quot; 

&quot;And I don&#39;t get a say in this? What if I&#39;m not even gay??&quot; You snap, glaring up at him. 

&quot;HAW HAW HAW.&quot; Beau holds his thick body as he shakes the room with laughter. &quot;//GAY// don&#39;t matter to me, ma cher. Shoo, I can make babies in whichever kinda hole&#39;s closest to me; &#39;gay&#39; don&#39;t mean nuthin&#39; to me no more!&quot; 

Well shit. If you attempt to turn and run, he&#39;ll simply reach out and grab you before you even get to your feet. He takes slow, lurching steps toward you and laughs quietly as he watches you scramble backwards. 

You&#39;re going to have to think outside the box here, and you might end up taking some werewolf dick one way other other; he&#39;s got you dead-to-rights. 

If you just &quot;surrender&quot; and [[offer to suck his dick...-&gt;PooMammySucc End]] it&#39;s better than letting him stuff that beast inside a much smaller hole, right? Plus, all this &#39;pregnant&#39; talk has you way nervous, he seems so confident about it. 

What if you could just [[talk him down?-&gt;PooMammyFuck 3]] He&#39;s able to be spoken to, he understands you just fine, he&#39;s hardly a feral animal... c&#39;mon, you&#39;re smarter than him! 

Wait. Maybe, you could //pretend// to be interested, and maybe like... stop looking so scared and scrabbling backwards. [[Approach him and maybe feel him up a bit?-&gt;PooMammy FalseSuccess]] It might distract him just long enough for you to turn and run! 

And then, if you&#39;re feeling... adventurous... maybe you could offer to just [[submit to him,-&gt;PooMammyFuck Submit]] with the caveat being he needs to take it easy on you since you&#39;ve CERTAINLY never had a monstrous werewolf penis inside you before. And if that&#39;s how you want to live your life, well... who&#39;s stopping you? </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="115" name="PooMammySucc End" tags="RG badend" position="2193,421" size="100,100">&quot;Ok ok ok wait, wait wait wait,&quot; you say. &quot;Look, uhh. Beau. My man. In case you hadn&#39;t noticed. Your uhh... pecker there. Is a good deal too big for the average, uhh... anus. Hole.&quot; 

Beau slams his hands down on either side of you; he&#39;s fully on top of you now, but just sort of looms there as if to make sure you know your place. &quot;Hawhaw. //Never stopped me before.//&quot; 

&quot;Well, ok, I mean that&#39;s fine, just hear me out,&quot; you say nervously. Fuck. You can&#39;t believe you&#39;re doing this, but... if it works, it works. You do what you gotta do to get by. &quot;Uh. What if I offered you... a different hole.&quot; 

&quot;... //Ohhhhh,// I gotcha!&quot; Beau says. He smiles. It&#39;s hard to tell he&#39;s smiling with his wolfy-monster-face, but you get the idea. &quot;You gonna let me fill that belly up from the OTHER end. I got no problem with that, smol fren. Heheh. Haw. Hawhaw.&quot; He looks around. &quot;Hmm. How we gonna do this... I got it.&quot; 

He grabs your shoulders and lifts you to your knees, then kneels in front of you, smirking, quite satisfied with this turn of events. 

You swallow and sigh, staring with extreme trepidation at the great big pecker pointing at your face. &quot;Uhh... well, uh... I guess here goes...&quot; And you bend forward and close your eyes, wincing, and open wide. 

Beau doesn&#39;t jerk you forward, but he does give you a little &#39;get on with it&#39; tug, making sure your mouth is immediately stuffed full of his soft, fleshy head. You cringe hard; you can feel your dignity just... draining out of you. Crap. You&#39;re suckin&#39; some cock. Monster-cock. Crap crap crap FUCKING SHIT. Beau pulls you onto himself a little further. It&#39;s not hard, it&#39;s more like he&#39;s just trying to... help you along. Almost encourage you. 

Oh fuck you&#39;re... you&#39;re feeling a little... gaggy. You flinch and look up at him, with begging and pleading in your eyes. 
&quot;You are CUTE, too,&quot; he says. &quot;That&#39;s a good look for you, smol fren.&quot; 

You try to take some more of it into your mouth but you&#39;re hardly experienced with having OBJECTS of this size, going down your throat... and then your eyes pop wide as you feel a gush of heat explode into you and down your throat. Sheesh, was that his cum? Well maybe that was... easier than you expected. You didn&#39;t even taste it, it just... plummeted down your throat, EW... 

&quot;There we go. Should make things a little more slippery up in there... ooooo you a WARM boy yes you are, nice n&#39; tight... keep on suckin&#39; smol fren,&quot; Beau moans. He pulls. You. Closer. He goes deeper in. How is he even fitting? You feel lightheaded. Uuuggghhh you can almost feel it twitching against your chest... how far in is he?? 

You have a horrible, sudden realization, as you feel him start to throb HARD: That wasn&#39;t cum earlier. That was pre. 

THIS. IS. CUM. You jerk hard, and spasm and twitch and try to pull off instinctively. BLOOSH BLOOSH BOOSH GOOSH. But Beau&#39;s hands grip you tight and hold you against his crotch. He doesn&#39;t want you to spill a drop. 

You start to quietly cry as buckets, what feels like GALLONS of cum fill your belly. Underneath you, your abdomen bulges down, heavier and fatter, and the more Beau pumps into you, the more your lower back sags with the weight of your swelling gut. 

You feel a &quot;pop!&quot; somewhere at your waistline and wonder if you&#39;ve burst, but you&#39;re [[passing out and don&#39;t really care anymore.-&gt;PooMammySucc End 2]] </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="116" name="PooMammyFuck 3" tags="RG badend" position="2309,679" size="100,100">&quot;Look, look,&quot; you say, putting your hands up to placate him for a moment. &quot;Ok I mean, I&#39;m not... I&#39;m not like really that //rich,// but if you want some money, I&#39;ll give you some money, ok? But you gotta let me go, &#39;cuz I don&#39;t even have bank account access here.&quot; 

Beau guffaws. He clutches his stomach as he laughs. &quot;What&#39;d I need money for? I got plenty &#39;o money. I get enough to eat, I got this nice house to sleep in...&quot; he grins as he looms over you. &quot;I definitely don&#39;t need money to //impregnate// yo&#39; BELLEH.&quot; 

You keep backpedaling. It&#39;s really just a formality at this point because he&#39;s right on top of you and at any moment, he could just decide... &quot;it&#39;s time,&quot; and grab you, and... well, that&#39;s what he does. He scoops you up in his right hand, and you feel a sharp tug at the waistband of your pants. 
He tears them right open and shreds your leather belt in the process. 

You kick your legs, more a reflex than anything. He peels your boxers down without ripping them. &quot;I, uhh, uhh, wait Beau, listen, uhh, I mean I&#39;m a GUY, right?? So...&quot; 

&quot;Mmm... yes you are.&quot; 

You let out a panicked yelp as he shoves his snout between your legs to inspect the goods. &quot;Dude wouldn&#39;t you rather have a girl??&quot; 

Beau freezes up for a sec. He holds you up and stares. &quot;... Can you turn yourself into a girl for me? That&#39;d be beautiful, I guarantee...&quot; 

&quot;Uhh... nnnooo??&quot; 

He snorts. He looks legit disappointed and flips you over in his hands OH FUCK there is a HUGE PENIS heading straight for you. &quot;Well why the fuck you bring it up then?&quot; Beau grumbles. He reaches down and adjust his pants. From what you can see, he ripped his overalls at the seams down there to let his pecker through. He almost sounds //offended// that you... can&#39;t... genderbend on command? 

&quot;Dude I meant like I&#39;d help you hire a good hooker!!&quot; you squeak out as you feel him poke you right in the ass. Slimy clear pre splooshes all over your posterior. 

&quot;Hmm... nnnaaah, that&#39;d take too long. I&#39;m ready to breed, NOW!&quot; Beau brings you close; he basically lowers you to the floor and lets you down on your hands and knees. You could crawl away, except he clearly intends to take you doggy-style (how fitting!) and his great big hands are wrapped firmly around your entire torso. 

You whimper and start to sob as he begins to press against you, and as you feel your hole starting to open up, you yell out one last desperate... thing: 

[[&quot;NO WAIT STOP I POOP FROM THERE!!&quot;-&gt;PooMammyFuck 4]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="117" name="PooMammy FalseSuccess" tags="RG badend" position="2321,550" size="100,100">//This is so dumb this is so fucking dumb but... shit, it might work...// 

You summon your absolute best acting skills-- you don&#39;t wanna lay it on too thick at first; gotta ease into it, like you&#39;re letting go of your fears. 

First you catch your breath, and try to relax your posture, and look more... at Beau&#39;s massive, bulky werewolf body. You try not to focus on any one part of him, more just, sizing him up. 

//Shit what do I say what do I say--// you say the first thing that comes to mind. &quot;So how&#39;d you get to be...&quot; you swallow; you said that kinda fast, like you&#39;re still scared shitless. 

Which you are, of course. 
But it does the trick: Beau&#39;s movements slow too, he maybe might not expect you to... flatter and admire him. This. Might. Actually. Work! 

&quot;Uhh, how&#39;d you, y&#39;know, turn into... a werewolf. Like.&quot; 

&quot;Oh, uhh...&quot; Beau definitely seems taken aback. He cocks his head at you. &quot;Well usually every night I change if I&#39;m really hungry, or REAL horny. Uhh. Yeah.&quot; 

&quot;Nonono, I mean, how did you actually BECOME, a werewolf. Like. What happened, that uhh... gave you the option. Of turning.&quot; This is good, this is REAL good. Keep him talking and thinking and distracted. You may not have his brute strength but you&#39;ve got heaps of brainpower advantage. 

&quot;Uh. I don&#39;t... rightly know,&quot; Beau frowns. He sits back on his haunches, like a titanic dog. &quot;Hmm. I remember... it were about ohh... I forgot. I&#39;m not even sure WHEN I changed. I feel like I always been this way.&quot; 

Ok. Ok. Good segue, good good good. You steady your breathing again and swallow your fears... and take a step closer, like you&#39;re admiring him. &quot;You&#39;re... //really BIG,//&quot; you say, letting some awestruck wonder slide into your attitude. 

&quot;... Heheh. Yeah. Yeah, sho&#39; am.&quot; Beau leans back a bit. His chest has puffed up. 

Ok. Ok. What sorts of things would YOU want to hear, if you were a great big hulking brute like this? You&#39;d want... to hear about your MUSCLES, definitely. &quot;Ffffuck, man... your arms are like... fuckin&#39; trees.&quot; It sounds kinda lame? but you do your best to sound more impressed, less... &#39;lusty.&#39; A bro admiring his bro at the gym, platonically. 

You&#39;re really close now, right in front of his left foot, and it&#39;s... sheesh, it&#39;s at least the size of your entire torso. You&#39;d straight-up DIE if he decided to kick you. You reach out and touch his foot, curiously. &quot;... does it hurt? Or does it feel good?&quot; 

&quot;Does what?&quot; 

&quot;When you transform. Is it like in the movies? Can you fight it off if you want? Can you do it during the daylight?&quot; All EXCELLENT questions, [[if you do say so yourself.-&gt;PooMammy FalseSuccess 2]] </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="118" name="PooMammyFuck Submit" tags="RG end" position="2320,431" size="100,100">&quot;Ok ok ok look, just wait a sec,&quot; you say quickly in a frantic voice. You&#39;ve even got both hands up. &quot;I... I don&#39;t...&quot; you take a moment to steady your voice. Beau is at least... letting you speak for the time being. &quot;Uhh. I honestly. Don&#39;t see how I can get out of this? So um. I guess. If... if you wanna, umm... fuck me...&quot; you just. 

You just feel so very small. 

&quot;Um. I guess. If you can please just make it not... hurt? Make it... I mean...&quot; 

&quot;Awww...&quot; Beau shrinks back a bit, and you see every single one of his sharp teeth as he beams down at you. &quot;That&#39;s nice. You mean you don&#39;t mind?&quot; 

&quot;Nono, I DO MIND,&quot; you say with both hands up at him. &quot;I mind very much! But. You&#39;re just gonna... take... what you want. Either way. So. If I just let you, without fighting... can you please just don&#39;t hurt me? Try to, you know... just get it over with and...&quot; you cringe. You almost feel like you might start crying. &quot;Just don&#39;t brutalize me, you know??&quot; 

&quot;Shoo, smol fren. I&#39;m almost insulted that you&#39;d think that of me,&quot; Beau says, still grinning, and he glides over you to pin you to the floor. His voice has gone low and smooth and rather sultry. He grips your wrists and pins your hands on either side of your head. &quot;I mean, you&#39;re right. I AM gonna claim you for myself. But. I wasn&#39;t gonna hurtcha in the process.&quot; 

You take a shuddery breath. &quot;... you weren&#39;t gonna like kill me and dump my body somewhere?&quot; 

&quot;HA! How am I gonna breed a dead body nah? If I could make babies with a dead person I wouldn&#39;t need YOU, smol fren,&quot; Beau chortles. &quot;Not wit&#39; all these GHOSTS everywhere.&quot; He raises his head and glares up at the ceiling. &quot;Especially not that invisible prick up there what likes to steal y&#39;all before I can get to ya.&quot; 

&quot;Invisible...?&quot; 

&quot;Ahh, I&#39;ll tell you &#39;bout him later. Let&#39;s go somewhere comfortable,&quot; Beau says. &quot;I&#39;m gonna fuck you like you NEVER been fucked. Next time I won&#39;t even have to ask; you&#39;ll be BEGGIN&#39; for it.&quot; 

His gigantic hands scoop you up and cradle you against his warm furry bulk, and he [[carries you upstairs to a bed.-&gt;PooMammyFuck Submit End]] </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="119" name="PooMammySucc End 2" tags="RG badend" position="2197,298" size="100,100">Uggghhh... you wake up feeling... really warm and groggy and not at all ready to be awake in the first place. What happened? Did you just pass out last night-- 

There&#39;s a big, strong male arm wrapped around your body. No wait, there&#39;s two. You&#39;re... being spooned? 

Speaking of male, there&#39;s a dick pressed against your back. Yeah. That too. A couple great big pecs; a slightly-padded-yet-firm gut... 

And ohh fuck, you let out this nasty, salty-tasting wet **belch** and shiver and look down at yourself. Your belly is just... swollen. Utterly stuffed, packed tight with... warmth. 

Cum. 
In your gut. 
You squint your eyes shut tight. Oh yeah, that&#39;s what happened last night. You got down and blew a werewolf. Who now seems to be cuddling against you, in his human form... He must&#39;ve carried you upstairs to a bed or something. &#39;Cuz you&#39;re both laying in one. 

You try to look around. Judging by the gray, dim light in the room... it&#39;s very early in the morning. Before sunup. 

The beefy smooth arms around you tighten up and give you a pleasant squeeze. &quot;Well nah, good morning,&quot; Beau&#39;s Cajun drawl vibrates against your back. His hands caress your bloated gut. &quot;Ohh hey nah. You&#39;ve lost some weight, hawhaw.&quot; 

&quot;Yeah, ha ha, now... lemme up,&quot; you gripe. 

Oh. Fuck. 

You look down and realize his arms are getting bigger and throbbing with bulges of fresh muscle. You can see a wave of dark fur spreading over his skin. You feel his pecs puffing up with additional bulk; he&#39;s //transforming// and crushing you in a cage of bestial muscles. 

&quot;Beau?? Beau we fuckin&#39; TALKED about this! We had a deal!!&quot; you thrash about in a vain attempt to break free and escape. 

&quot;Well I know, I know, and I feel real bad,&quot; and you can hear his voice getting deeper and gruffer with every word. One of his growing hands comes up to ruffle your hair; the other pats your sloshy belly gently. &quot;But see, if I don&#39;t impregnate SOMEone, I&#39;m just gonna keep turnin&#39; into a monster every night, whether I want to or not. So since I gotcha here, and you ain&#39;t goin&#39; nowhere--&quot; 

&quot;I wanna go HOME BeauuUUGGHGHHH!!&quot; you let out a roar that turns into a grunting... well, a squeal. As he PLUNGES his fattening cock inside your rear. It&#39;s already fairly hefty but then it swells to fit and seems to lock in place as it finishes its own transformation (which is really just... a major growth spurt, as you got up close and personal with it last night and could clearly see it was still human-shaped). 

Within seconds, Beau has fired off a full 21-gun salute into your poor aching tummy, bloating you even bigger than last night. &quot;Mmm. That&#39;s more like it. You know, I think I&#39;m gonna keep you,&quot; he croons into the back of your neck. &quot;You can be my lil-bitty smol cumdumpster fren.&quot; 

**END** 

You have been DOUBLE-STUFFED! 

You are now Beau&#39;s breeder. His life&#39;s certainly much easier now that he doesn&#39;t have to attempt to lure people to Bayou Lourde. Not while he&#39;s got such a nice breeder within arm&#39;s reach at all times. You... you just can&#39;t move, is all. 

No, it&#39;s not because you&#39;re pregnant, either. Although you are-- more on that in a minute. It&#39;s because, every time he sees you trying to escape with your big sloshy self, Beau simply turns into his Rougarou form and unloads a fresh batch of steamin&#39; hot werewolf seed down your throat. He keeps you incapacitated for... shoot. Days? Weeks? Every day your body gets bigger and rounder and heavier, with a fucking WEREWOLF PUP growing inside, and by the end of the month you&#39;re so big and hefty that Beau doesn&#39;t even feel the need to load you with cum anymore. 

Of course, he carries you around, feeds you, keeps you company, and protects you from the various... ghosts and other things that lurk in and around the plantation. But you belong to Beau now, and probably will for a long time, constantly carrying and birthing cute little werewolf puppies. Always pregnant, always heavy with cum and rougarou baby. </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="120" name="PooMammyFuck Submit End" tags="RG end" position="2390,303" size="100,100">Your brain sort of shuts down-- cognitive dissonance perhaps-- and before you know it, you&#39;re naked flat on your back atop an old sturdy bed.

&quot;Nah, first, we lube ya up some,&quot; and he reaches down and pulls your legs wide open. Goodness, you&#39;re so //vulnerable,// like this.

He reaches down and strokes himself for a few seconds, until

&quot;Hmmhmm... there we go.&quot; You actually SEE the clear splashes erupting all over and... eeewwww, //inside// you. Ugh! Some lands on your thighs and belly.

&quot;Is that it there?&quot; he asks, angling his shaft. You feel it jab! at your innards.

He pats your chest. &quot;How&#39;s that smol fren?&quot; He leans back up off you and pops his fur-covered pecs a few times. &quot;That&#39;s how you know I&#39;m a PROPER good stud. You can&#39;t even //talk.//&quot; 

You open your mouth. What comes out is a noise that might have been a word in any other circumstance, but here, sounds more like a wailing moan of disbelieving pleasure. 

&quot;Heheheh. HAWHAW.&quot; Beau&#39;s vast hands wrap entirely around your lower back, his thumbs pressing into your stomach. &quot;Perfect. Alright. So. Now I&#39;m gonna. Impregnate you. You ready?&quot; 

&quot;AHhhHHAHHAHHHHHNNnnnggg...&quot; 

He humps and humps. &quot;You ready for to get //pregnant// ma cher?&quot; 

&quot;MmmMMMMmmmMmMM!!!&quot; your head is just like, flopping around now. Your hands grip at the bed below. Something&#39;s wrong with your dick apparently; it&#39;s not supposed to be enjoying this but it&#39;s like, drooling almost non-stop. No wait. It&#39;s... yeah that&#39;s it. You just fired your load. 

And then Beau fires his. 
It feels like you&#39;re sharing his great big werewolf heart. There&#39;s just this... massive, pounding, thumping, this //rhythmic pulsating...// fuck, it&#39;s like someone&#39;s opened an EDM club in your abdomen. You just sort of start to black out, watching this weird you-colored balloon blow up somewhere down where your gut should be. 

**END** 

That. Was incredible. 

When you come to, Beau has brought you some tasty breakfast-- which you puke up before you can finish, as you are ABSOLUTELY pregnant somehow. Perhaps it&#39;s for the best that you don&#39;t understand the mechanics of it. After all, what are you supposed to do when a massive, muscular, MANLY monster cums in your tummy? //Not// get pregnant? Like for real. 

You really liked it though. And... you&#39;re a little scared of the whole thing. Since it&#39;s unfamiliar territory. But for some ass-backwards reason (no pun intended) you kinda feel safe hanging with Beau for the time being, since... he&#39;s the daddy... mm. BIG Daddy. 

You opt to put your little investigation of the plantation on hold for now. Beau takes you across the swamp, back to your car, and you follow him back to his place. And then he... he just gives you the rundown, on everything. Bayou Lourde&#39;s history and the plantation&#39;s history and the people who lived there and some of the swamp&#39;s... odder or more notable residents. Maybe you&#39;ll meet them someday. 

But for now, you, apparently, have a boyfriend. A great big beefy friendly protective... boyfriend. 
A great big //werewolf// boyfriend. 
Whose great big werewolf baby you&#39;re carrying in a steadily swelling gut. No seriously, within a week you look like you&#39;re almost half-term. 

... well, shittier things have happened to you, you suppose. </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="122" name="PooMammy FalseSuccess 2" tags="RG badend" position="2440,554" size="100,100">&quot;Uhh, heheh.&quot; Beau looks tickled pink that you&#39;re asking him all these questions. It&#39;s like no one&#39;s ever asked before. &quot;Uhh. Well I CAN try to fight it off, yeah. Sometimes it hurts, sometimes it feels good, yeah. Uhh. I won&#39;t say it&#39;s EXACTLY like the movies, but...&quot; 

He reaches out and grabs you-- this action consists of one of his massive hands wrapping almost entirely around your torso to pin your arms to your sides. And he pulls you in. &quot;I could show you sometime, yeah?&quot; 

Crap, crap crap. Gotta redirect him. You let out a... dumb little giggle and pop one arm free of his grip, and run it as far down his bulging forearm as you can. His fur is REALLY soft and you actually kinda like it. &quot;Shit dude. How much can you lift like this?&quot; 

&quot;Hmm. Lots.&quot; Beau then rights himself and...

Well, he curls you. Like a dumbbell. You try not to panic and pretend to be delighted. &quot;Yeah but, hahaha! I&#39;m not that heavy anyway...&quot; 

He pulls you close to his face, leering at you. &quot;You gonna BE heavy when I stuff my babies up in you...&quot; 

Okokok! Don&#39;t be intimidated! Just play the game... he&#39;s... just a big overly-friendly dog... right? You reach up and feel the super-soft fur behind his pointed ears, and you rub, just like you would anybody&#39;s pet. 

//It. Works.// You feel his grip loosen and he actually leans into it. 
This big guy is STARVED for affection apparently. &quot;Nah that... that feels nice, nah...&quot; 

You smirk at him. &quot;If I rolled you on your back and gave you belly rubs, would your foot do that kickin&#39; thing?&quot; 

&quot;That, nah, THAT is RACIST,&quot; Beau says, but he starts shaking with laughter, and then... WHOA your entire world upends as he rolls backwards, flopping down on the floor, and takes you with him. 

And then you land between his bulging great pecs, and push yourself up. 

For just a second you are utterly shocked at yourself. You thought you were gonna end up UNDERNEATH this big fucker, and here you are, //on top// of him. 

&quot;Well go on then!&quot; Beau says, almost like he&#39;s daring you to try. 

You chuckle quietly. Then you turn around, ass in his face, which will PROBABLY distract him further but not... hopefully... get him too horny. And you start to give him great big belly rubs. All over his exposed stomach. He&#39;s very, very firm, despite his rather thick, padded appearance. Damn, the FUR. It&#39;s. So. SOFT. You use both hands and full-range of motion to give him the best belly rubs you can imagine. 

&quot;Ahhhh yyyeaahhh,&quot; Beau says. His great big arms flop down to the sides. You don&#39;t see his feet kicking at all; rather, they lay inert. 

You&#39;re //relaxing// him. This is good, too! Shit, what if you just, &quot;full-on Looney Tunes outsmarting a giant,&quot; put him to sleep this way? 

[[You better compliment him again though.-&gt;PooMammy FalseSuccess 3]] </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="123" name="PooMammy FalseSuccess 3" tags="RG badend" position="2443,678" size="100,100">And what a moment to decide to compliment him again! You start to speak: &quot;Shit dude, I almost kinda wanna try being a, uhh... what&#39;d you say earlier? A Roo-ga-roo?&quot; 

Your voice falters as you watch his manhood slide out from between his legs-- there&#39;s a perfectly-sized hole in his ragged overalls, like he made it himself as his body bulked up and he grew claws on his fingers. 

&quot;Uhh, yeah,&quot; you nod. You keep up the belly rubs; you also devote some attention to his pecs, which, unlike his abdomen, are ABSOLUTELY solid with much less fat padding them out. The big pecker engorges and aims straight for your face. You feel like you&#39;re being held at gunpoint. 

&quot;Big, ain&#39;t it,&quot; Beau mutters. He grins down at you. 

&quot;I mean. Heh. I bet it&#39;s awesome to just be... you know. I mean look how &#39;small&#39; I am, and look how... fuckin&#39; MASSIVE you are...&quot; 

Beau&#39;s flattered chuckle signals your success. &quot;Well if I knew how to change you, I would, I guarantee, but then... that&#39;d be makin&#39; competition for myself. You&#39;re better off...&quot; he reaches up and gives YOU a belly rub. &quot;Carryin&#39; mah pups. Or maybe. Heheh.&quot; He pats his gut on either side of you. &quot;Maybe I could try to stuff you in here. And then I&#39;d get even BIGGER. Lawd sakes, I ain&#39;t put down a whole boy in a long-ass time...&quot; 

That. Is the kind of talk you want to avoid. That is death talk. &quot;Oh yeah? Is that a thing?&quot; you ask, turning around on his belly to reach behind you with a sly hand. &quot;Do you start off as a regular-person-sized werewolf and like, get bigger every time you eat someone?&quot; 

&quot;HAWHAW no, well, I... maybe? Like I said it&#39;s been a long time... I don&#39;t remember turnin&#39;, but I DO remember eatin&#39; someone way back then... or somethin&#39;. I get plenty to eat anyways,&quot; Beau shrugs. &quot;When times are hard, I just come here, head over to the kitchen, and get Mammy&#39;s attention. That old ghost&#39;ll stuff you so full you won&#39;t move for DAYS.&quot; 

&quot;Huh.&quot; 

[[You grab his dick and start to stroke.-&gt;PooMammy FalseSuccess 4]] </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="124" name="PooMammy FalseSuccess 4" tags="RG badend" position="2440,804" size="100,100">&quot;Oh! Ohohoho!&quot; Beau jerks underneath you and grins wildly. &quot;Oh you wanna PLAY, huh?&quot; 

&quot;Just wanna find out if you&#39;re capable of giving yourself a facial,&quot; you say, and turn to slide down his belly, past his dick. You land on your feet with his thighs on either side of you like two fallen tree trunks, and get to work jerking him off. 

It&#39;s hardly dignified, right? But it&#39;s doing the trick, against your better judgment. Beau&#39;s head is tilted back and his tongue is lolling out. &quot;That&#39;s it, that&#39;s it boy... that&#39;s my smol fren right there... whooo...&quot; 

You use... both hands. Again. Because you kinda have to. It&#39;s at least as big around as your wrist. You CAN&#39;T let that thing go inside you; it&#39;ll break you in half! You keep stroking him. You get as much distance as possible, with a few smaller swipes just to-- 

His thighs close in around you, just a bit... and his hands come up to clutch you around your torso. Ok. Ok. No biggie. Once he starts cumming, he&#39;ll let go, and he&#39;ll be so busy doing that, that he won&#39;t notice you running off and hiding until you&#39;re long gone. It&#39;s cool. 

You just keep on. Jerkin&#39; off a werewolf. That&#39;s great. You don&#39;t mind his hands around you really; it feels kinda nice... except when they SQUEEEEEEzzzze oof they squeeze pretty hard. If he wanted to pop you like a grape, he definitely could. These must be his version of &#39;gentle&#39; squeezes. 

Beau&#39;s panting. He&#39;s gotta be close. &quot;Yeah boy. Yyyyyeah boy. C&#39;mon. Gimme dat.&quot; Good, good, you&#39;re almost done. You can just shove it down and make him spew his cum all up in his face to blind him maybe... 

Oooohhhh fuck fuck fuck he&#39;s lifting you up, this wasn&#39;t part of the plan, uhh, ok you can improvise! You just gotta grab his shaft with your arms and legs and hug it... nonono he&#39;s pulling you off and-- and one of his CLAWS pokes your ASS and TEARS A BIG HOLE IN YOUR JEANS RIGHT DOWN THE CRACK

and he slams you home

your eyes pop out and you go all... stiff, yet slack
like a broken toy
The first gush of hot cum blooms in your bowels and lubricates you, allowing him to push further in. The second gush splurts out around his shaft, which only makes things easier. The third gush doesn&#39;t leak out at all because he&#39;s in far enough, and the fourth gush feels like it punches you right in the heart. 

And this all takes place within about 3 seconds. 
The remaining gushes, of which there are many, [[blast into your belly immediately after.-&gt;PooMammy FalseSuccess 5]] </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="125" name="PooMammy FalseSuccess 5" tags="RG badend" position="2300,810" size="100,100">BOOSH-BOOSH-GOOSH-BOOSH-

Your eyes go crossed
and you vaguely stare down at your flat stomach plumping up into a nice hot steamy ball, tight and sloshy and round, and you just... 

drift off... 

**END** 

You have been //impregnated.// Royally, utterly, undeniably seeded. Claimed. Bred. 

With your body so full and heavy with Beau&#39;s load, you&#39;re either unconscious, or otherwise immobile. So you don&#39;t get to leave. You can barely walk as it is; your ass is... well, Beau says it&#39;s for the best, since you&#39;ve now got one of his pups in your tummy. 

It&#39;s a good thing you don&#39;t have a day job to report to. You&#39;d just quit a few months back once your viewcount and subscriber count really started to pick up. It&#39;s a slight case of counting your chickens before they hatch, but... nothing ventured, nothing gained. 

Speaking of gaining things, your weight and girth absolutely BALLOONS within a month, and you just. keep. getting. bigger. Beau refuses to explain, or even show any scientific interest, in your otherwise incompatible anatomy bearing him a child. Nothing beyond a chuckle and a &quot;I&#39;m just that manly, smol fren,&quot; or some bullshit about rougarous and possibly?magic? and what-the-fuck-ever right? You can figure it out later when you&#39;re NOT pregnant. 

Beau doesn&#39;t want you posting this all over the Internet either. 

At least, until you, in one last act of desperation, propose that of the billions of people with Internet access, there&#39;s BOUND to be more than just a few who&#39;d love to come on down to Bayou Lourde and get themselves knocked up by a werewolf. Beau agrees to this, but he&#39;s got all the cards, and so it looks like you&#39;re gonna be his special breedin&#39; boy for... well, either a few more pups, or some rather fetishy &quot;hey look I&#39;ve got me a pregnant guy that I knocked up myself&quot; videos. Whichever comes first. </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="126" name="PooMammyFuck 4" tags="RG badend" position="2174,804" size="100,100">You cringe at what you&#39;ve just said and... slowly turn your head back to give him your most pleading, qualifying, begging look. Utterly pitiful puppy dog eyes leaking the first few tears of defeat. 

Beau stares at you. His big green werewolf eyes shine slightly in the dim light. His dick upends and slides between your cheeks like a hot dog; pre flows down and starts to pool in the small of your back. 

And Beau lets out a bewildered laugh. And then he doesn&#39;t. Stop. Laughing. For minutes on end. &quot;Heh. Hehehehe. HA! HAA! HAHAHAHA!! HAWHAWHAWHAW!!HAAWWW. AAAAHH HA HA HAHA HAHAHA...&quot; 

One of his hands reaches up and wipes his eyes. &quot;Hey. Hey MAMMY!!&quot; 

... the fuck&#39;s a &#39;mammy?&#39; 

&quot;YO MAMMY!!&quot; Beau hollers. His voice shakes the house, it seems. &quot;MAMMY VI!!&quot; 

&quot;Chile whatchu bellerin&#39; about in here makin&#39; that godawful noise? I&#39;m busy makin&#39; dinner!&quot; says a voice. 

And then you see it. Her. A pale, vaguely glowing, FACE, appears from the wall off to the right. THERE&#39;S A GHOST!! Right there!! And you&#39;re... in absolutely no position to film her! She&#39;s got a little... thing on her head, like a hanky or do-rag, and you start to see more of her phase through the wall... she&#39;s a cook? Yeah, she&#39;s got an apron, she&#39;s a BIG lady, she looks... rather pleasant. 

&quot;Help??&quot; you squeak up at her. 

&quot;Mammy,&quot; Beau is barely able to cough out, he&#39;s laughing so hard still. He points down at you like you need attention. &quot;You see him? Apparently he POOP from that hole.&quot; 

&quot;He POOP from that hole??&quot; Mammy gasps. 

&quot;Heheheh. Hawhaw! That&#39;s what he say.&quot; 

&quot;Don&#39;t everybody poop from that hole??&quot; Mammy pats her apron and dusts her hands off, creating a small ghostly white cloud akin to flour or chalk. 

&quot;Pretty soon he gonna be poopin&#39; BABIES from that hole,&quot; Beau chuckles. 

&quot;Lawd sakes Beauregard you //filthy// animal, committin&#39; the impregnatory sodomy up in my house, AGAIN?&quot; Mammy says, though despite her offended tone she puts a hand to her mouth, so she can fail at covering her smirk. &quot;As if there ain&#39;t enough mouths to feed around here already. When you gonna find you a nice girl and settle yo hairy ass down??&quot; 

Beau growls playfully, and... you squeal and yell as he shoves a few inches of himself inside. &quot;When this stop bein&#39; so much fun, that&#39;s when.&quot; 

&quot;Sakes alive chile,&quot; Mammy sighs. She fades into the wall, shaking her head. &quot;Where&#39;s my jug at, I need a drink, mmm...&quot; 

Beau //plunges// deep into you. No amount of clenching can keep him out; his pre lubricates you plenty and once he&#39;s got you widened enough, he just keeps shoving it in. &quot;There we go nah,&quot; he croons in your ear as he wraps his arms around your body to pull you upright. &quot;Now we gonna get you pregnant. I&#39;mma hold you up just like this,&quot; and you feel his snout, his face, rest on your shoulder, &quot;so I can watch you blow up nice and round with my babies... ohh shit, where&#39;s my manners? Here you go.&quot; 

And then he sort of... FUCK. SWISHES. AROUND. SHIT. INSIDE. FUCK. and suddenly his dick bumps into what you can only describe as the male-version of a g-spot, because your brain goes almost completely blank and your own dick rises to full attention straightaway, and you start trying to hump the air. 

&quot;There we go. Much better,&quot; Beau says, and with a couple more thrusts, you feel him [[start to cream your belly absolutely full.-&gt;PooMammy FalseSuccess 5]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="127" name="Stealth Living Room" tags="RG" position="1791,577" size="100,100">Quietly, you slip into the living room. The sheet-covered furniture spooks you just a bit-- normally it wouldn&#39;t, but normally you don&#39;t have a loudly growling monster approaching your position. 

You... might actually be too scared to move. It happens to the best of us. It&#39;s always an inconvenience too, seeing as how being frozen with fear makes it rather difficult to get away from whatever&#39;s got you scared. 

You remain quiet, and still, and listen. You start to hear some footsteps again... getting a little louder. The floorboards creak under its weight. 

Ok. You&#39;ve got to think, think, THINK. Uhh. You&#39;ve committed to hiding, now, so... ffffuck it&#39;s so stressful. Everything is a threat, everything! The inky black shapes all around you, the... sheets... 

Hmm... there&#39;s lots of furniture in here. The chair you&#39;re in currently, there&#39;s a couch over there, there&#39;s a lounge, a table... hmm. That floor lamp over there is about your height... and that fancy old couch, looks like it&#39;s got a veritable crawlspace under it. Shoot... you&#39;re almost desperate enough to try climbing up the chimney; it&#39;s certainly an unorthodox tactic but you should be able to fit, right? 

You&#39;ve got to act fast if you&#39;re going to hide from that thing. 
Do you: 

[[crawl under the couch-&gt;Stealth Under Couch]]? 

[[head for the floor lamp-&gt;Stealth Under Lampshade]]? 

[[climb up the chimney shaft-&gt;ClimbUp Chimney]]?</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="128" name="Normal RG Run" tags="RG" position="1549,591" size="100,100">You creep out into the hallway. It&#39;s good timing: as you step through the threshold, you can hear the footsteps stomp into the parlor and there&#39;s the sound of a piece of wooden furniture being knocked over. The creature sounds like it&#39;s sniffing around. The old house creaks under the substantial weight of the beast. 

You set your phone to record. It seems dumb to worry about such things but you&#39;ve got to remind yourself why you&#39;re here. If you don&#39;t record the GOOD SHIT then what was the point of the trip? But you stay silent; there&#39;s nothing good that will come from trying to narrate anything and giving your position away. 

The front door&#39;s shut; if you open it, it will surely make a noise and the beast will be on you in seconds. So that&#39;s out. 
The main staircase leading up is to your right. It&#39;s definitely old and creaky. Across the hall is the open threshold leading into the Dining Room. And... down the hall, on the right side, is the archway the monster just went through into the Parlor. 

At the far end of the hall, you see a door on the left. It might be a bathroom but you can&#39;t tell from here. It&#39;s too close to the Parlor&#39;s entrance anyway. Beyond that, there&#39;s a back entrance with a pair of beautiful stained-glass doors. One of them is open... 

You have maybe a few seconds to weigh your options before you MUST move in order to stay ahead of the monster stalking in the other room. 

[[Head towards the back entrance?-&gt;Normal RG BackAlert]] You&#39;ll have to be very sneaky... 

... likewise if you attempt to [[go upstairs.-&gt;UpstairsCumf Scene]] 

The Dining Room is, of course, closest to your position, but from what you&#39;ve seen of it, offers little cover. Still, it has to lead to the kitchen, which may have some... cupboards you can squeeze into, maybe? [[Sneak into the Dining Room-&gt;SneakDiningRoom]] if you dare. 
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="129" name="Stealth Under Couch" tags="RG" position="1641,1201" size="100,100">You get down and slide under the couch, quickly. You make sure to fix the sheet so it&#39;s not tucked in against your body, pointing straight at your hiding spot. From anyone&#39;s point of view, there&#39;s nobody in the room, and certainly nobody within the vicinity of the couch. As an afterthought you pull your phone out to record for a moment. 

Shit this is stupid. It can probably smell you, whatever it is. You feel like a little kid, cowering under the blankets and hoping the boogeyman goes away. Fear grips you when you hear the heavy footsteps thump into the room, the snuffling sniffs as it searches for you. 

Ok. Ok. You&#39;re doing fine. You just. Have. To hold. Still. 
And keep your breathing steady and silent. You can do it. 

One of its feet descends RIGHT next to the couch. You can feel your heart playing the opening drum solo to that one Van Halen song. It&#39;s like you&#39;re emitting sonar pulses that are going to lead it straight to you... 

It leaves?? It&#39;s going away?? You hear the feet walking out of the room. Shit, the entire house seems to protest under this beast&#39;s weight. Everything creaks or shudders when the big guy takes a step. 

And WOW you were able to get a shot of its feet, stepping just next to the couch, and then walking away. Granted all from underneath the sheet, so you and the camera on your phone couldn&#39;t see anything ELSE. But damn that&#39;s gonna be an exciting video clip! 

You try to listen for where it went; you THINK you heard a door open, and then close. Did it actually close a door behind itself? Either way it&#39;s left the area. You should be safe to move now, so you slip out from under the couch. 

&quot;Holy SHIT guys did you SEE THAT?&quot; you whisper at your phone camera, and wipe your wrist against your sweaty forehead. &quot;Wow.&quot; 

You stop recording and pick somewhere else to go: 

At the far end of the main hallway is a set of ornate, stained glass doors leading outside. You&#39;ll definitely be sure to check first, but you could [[take a peek out the back door.-&gt;Stealth SuccBackDoor]]

Across from the living room, is an open archway that leads into the dining room. You assume the kitchen is nearby. [[Think it&#39;s worth a look?-&gt;SneakDiningRoom]] 

And then just around the corner to the right, is the [[main staircase, which is sure to be creaky,-&gt;Upstairs Landing]] so step carefully and lightly if you climb them. </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="130" name="Stealth Under Lampshade" tags="RG badend" position="1932,551" size="100,100">It almost seems ridiculous to think it&#39;ll actually work, but... you&#39;ve committed. It&#39;s either gonna work, or you&#39;re fuckin&#39; dead. You move as quick-yet-quiet as you can across the big living room, heading for the floor lamp in the corner. It&#39;s a big antique artpiece, basically-- a large flared shade creates ample space below under the sheet where you can stand. 

You grip the back of the sheet to hold it still. You can&#39;t have it making ANY motion-- although, to be fair, the house is drafty enough to make all the sheet-draped furniture flutter from time to time. Ok. Ok just relax. You&#39;ve got this. You&#39;re covered. You look just like another piece of furniture. Now you just have to hold //still// and hope it doesn&#39;t... 

You suck in a quivering breath. The heavy, thunderous footsteps of the monster have just entered the living room; you can see the great big ominous shape on the far side, coming from the parlor. It&#39;s just this huge black shadowy shape, looming large and imposing. Terror clutches at your soul when you see the two pinpricks of gleaming light, halfway to the high ceiling. It&#39;s. Very tall. Very wide. Whatever it is... could it be a bear?? Do they even have those here?? 

//It&#39;s bipedal.// You hear it sniff. You see it coming closer, moving among the main group of furniture. It sniffs the chair, the couch... shit, you almost HID under there, it would have discovered you immediately. 

You just gotta stay calm. It can&#39;t see you under here right? You close your eyes and take the quietest, deepest breath; for about a second you ente
r an odd sort of &quot;zen&quot; state that seems to shut the entire world out. 

[[The sheet on the lamp flies up and off in a whirl of cotton fabric.-&gt;Stealth Lamp Fail]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="131" name="Stealth Lamp Fail" tags="RG badend" position="2180,924" size="100,100">You have just enough time to open your eyes, emit a terrified gasp, and take in the full sight of the enormous beast standing in front of you. It is unmistakably a werewolf; it looks a LOT like that one you saw in that one movie that one time. Massive, muscular, furry, and... drooling. 

You&#39;re dead-to-rights. You scream when it snatches you up in one great big hand and lifts you up to its face. The jaws are in front of your nose. The hot breath would fog your glasses if you wore any. 

The monster sniffs you a few times. You cringe away from its snout, not that it does you any good. You can only think of one thing to do, and it&#39;s ONLY because you&#39;ve got your phone in your hand: you take a picture of the monster, right in its face. You tap at the screen again and swipe and turn on &#39;record.&#39; 

It blinks irritably and just... holds you. It lets out a little snort, almost as if to say &#39;that&#39;s it?&#39; 

Then your entire world tilts up and forward. You&#39;re screaming again, a desperate panicked battlecry. Your phone goes flying as you raise your hand to fight back, but your head plunges straight into the beast&#39;s mouth. You feel its tongue on your chest. For a moment you are able to bring both hands up to grab... its cheeks, its jaws, a tooth, anything you can grab and push against. 

It doesn&#39;t work. The huge werewolf is far too strong. It simply grabs both of your arms and pins them to your sides, and then you feel a great big hand push your ass. The monster tips its head back. 

You slide in easy. Down, down its throat. Soft, wet, heat, squishy... rhythmic undulations of muscle pull your body in and you //slide// down. It&#39;s slippery as hell. You hear the teeth clack shut somewhere above you. You are still screaming. 

[[You land in a hot steamy belly.-&gt;RG LampVore]] </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="132" name="RG LampVore" tags="RG badend" position="2317,926" size="100,100">You wonder if this is what it&#39;s like to be in a clothes dryer. You&#39;re rolling all around inside a huge gut, it&#39;s dark, it&#39;s wet, it&#39;s hot. You&#39;re yelling //something,// but it&#39;s probably not important. Your brain has gone into &#39;fight or die&#39; mode. 

Every time you manage to right yourself, you feel like you get flipped over again. No way is right-side up anymore, except whichever way doesn&#39;t get the blood pooling in your skull. The monster must be running around or something. 

You feel its motions stop all around you and you right yourself again, then begin to REALLY kick and press and squirm. You can&#39;t get any leverage though. It&#39;s sort of like punching underwater; there&#39;s no room to build any momentum to actually make it painful. 

You get exhausted and curl up in a ball, breaking down in tears. You got fucking EATEN??? Really?? That&#39;s how it&#39;s gonna be? 

... at least there doesn&#39;t seem to be like, a pool of boiling acid eating away at your body. You feel all tingly and hot, and definitely soaking wet, but... there&#39;s no pain. You just sort of sit there, crying yourself into a daze. You&#39;re too tired to fight anymore. 

... curiously it almost feels like you&#39;re... hungry? You just feel empty, is all. The soft wet walls squish in on you and compress you. You&#39;ve got no idea what //shrinking// feels like, but you can only imagine it&#39;d feel similar to this. Just... more dry. 

You black out. 

**LATER?** 

Did you just get yourself fucking EATEN?! 

Thankfully it seems to be... non-permanent? Because you wake up rather abruptly, and you&#39;re curled up on the floor of... wait, where are you? You&#39;re still in the mansion, it seems. You have a look around. It seems lighter than before; how long were you out? And... 

and where the FUCK is that big motherfuck-- HOOOLLYY SHIT. 

You back away from the sleeping hulk. Did it spit you out or something? Who the fuck cares, you swivel around and locate the door to this bedroom it carried you up to, and get the fuck outta Dodge. 

Downstairs you head for the front door, but then you remember you dropped your phone, and you kinda need that shit. You round the corner. It&#39;s odd; you don&#39;t see the sun coming up, and it still looks... dark out. And yet you can see just fine in the dim gray lighting. Your eyes must&#39;ve really adjusted, being inside that big furry piece of crap all this time. 

There&#39;s your phone, lying on the floor under a chair. It didn&#39;t fly too far thankfully. You bend down and reach your hand under the chair. 

... the fuck? Why can&#39;t you reach it? It&#39;s like right there... You try again, and again. Then you lean down and stare at your phone, with your head against the carpet. 

Ok... it&#39;s recording... You look around, have a listen for the monster, and decide to flip the chair, since you apparently can&#39;t reach your phone. 

[[You hoist the chair up and gently lower it down.-&gt;RG LampVore 2]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="133" name="RG LampVore 2" tags="RG badend" position="2444,928" size="100,100">When you bend down for your phone, you spit a nasty curse out when your fingers slip and-- 

//turn pale glowy white for just a second//

You yelp and look at your hand. It looks normal? Same color as always... And you grab for your phone again, and you watch as your entire hand goes RIGHT THROUGH IT, phasing like a ghost, and your flesh pales and glows in its wake. And then it&#39;s back to normal. 

Are you...?? 

WHAT THE FUCK?!?

You scrabble your fingers around for your phone; you use both hands, you slap it and swat and kick and bring your fists down on it. It just lays there, completely untouched, and by the time you collapse onto your side in anguished tears, you get to watch your hands and arms glow a foggy shade of off-white. You can&#39;t touch it. 

Because... 

With an inarticulate shriek of rage, you rush to the stairs and burst into the room where you left the monster sleeping-- or you try to, as your hand goes right through the half-closed door you intended to slam open. You don&#39;t even know what you intend to do but you&#39;re too pissed off to think. 

You can clearly see the drowsy beast&#39;s great big hands clutching at its abdomen. It&#39;s laying on its back like a dog, but it has a noticable curve to its belly. Like it&#39;s almost done digesting... a you-sized meal. It gurgles and //glorps// and the werewolf snores. 

You hang your head and let out a final sob of utter despair. Your entire body flickers, transparent and slightly luminescent. 

**END** 

You have been eaten by a werewolf... and are now a ghost. 

You quickly discover the new freedoms and limitations of your undead self. You can basically move OR pass through most &quot;real&quot; items-- except your fucking phone, which sits there recording for about a day or so until it dies. It just lays there. You can&#39;t touch it and that has to be some form of infernal torment against you. You can&#39;t call for help. 

You can go through shit, and float around, and fade into invisibility if you want. Other ghosts can see you at all times, but to the living, you just disappear completely. It would be a lot more fun if you were, you know, STILL ALIVE!!

You can interact with the other residents of the mansion. The cooking lady in the kitchen is kind enough and provides ghostly food to ease ghostly hunger pangs-- yes, somehow you still get hungry, but you can&#39;t eat anything real to take care of it. The invisible bastard upstairs is a total jerk and won&#39;t talk to you at all. There&#39;s one room that&#39;s locked upstairs and you can&#39;t get into it, not through the floors or the ceiling... 

There&#39;s a strange and frightening presence that sometimes roams the house and exits; you can&#39;t see her or sense her other than just a general sense of her movements and that she should absolutely be avoided. 

And then there&#39;s the FUCKING werewolf-- who turns out to be motherfucking bitch-ass BEAU-- and you vow to haunt the fuck outta him as much as possible. You can&#39;t scare him of course, but you can irritate the crap outta him whenever he&#39;s around, and you actually can follow him quite some distance from Bayou Lourde-- to the nearby town, where he lives-- but you&#39;re like //tethered// to him, and if he roams too far from the bayou or you get too far away from //him,// you just sort of... teleport back to the bedroom where you woke up after being, uhh. Ghosty-fied. 

Your only hope now is that some of your subscribers back home have contacted the authorities about your missing presence. Maybe some of them will even journey here to find out what happened to you. Shoot, maybe they can figure out a way to bring you back! If not to life, then... at least back home, so you can tell everyone what happened... Hopefully you don&#39;t have to scare them away to keep them from getting themselves eaten, too. </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="134" name="Stealth SuccBackDoor" tags="" position="1778,1206" size="100,100">You approach the back door. You can&#39;t really see anything outside, the stained glass prevents that. It&#39;s very pretty though. 

You have to crack the door open just a bit in order to peer out. You move it extremely slowly, so you don&#39;t reveal your position. 

Off in the treeline you see a dark shape moving. You pull the door shut. Nope! Stayin&#39; in the house, for sure. Whatever that was-- it was too far to see if it was the werewolf thing or not-- it&#39;s just probably best to stay inside for now. 

Sooo...

**CREEEEEAAK** 

old fucking creaky boards!!

You hear an alerted huff in the living room. 

[[Run to the back door!-&gt;Normal RG Backdoor Fail]] 

No wait, there&#39;s a door under the stairs! Looks like it goes down into a cellar or something, [[go there instead!-&gt;RG Chase into Base]]

&quot;NONONO!!&quot; You shriek as a pair of huge, muscular, //bulging// furry arms wrap around you and jerk you back. They clamp you tight against the monster&#39;s vast chest; you can feel the fur brushing against your ears and cheeks. You kick and flail with each limb. You can escape this! You can, you can, you just gotta nail him in the nuts or something-- 

The great big arms tighten up around you and begin to squeeze, to SQUEEZE, to //crush!!!// 

You gasp and pant. 

SQUEEZE. 

SMUSH... 

CRUSH... 

you go limp; you can&#39;t breathe, you can&#39;t move, you can&#39;t escape. You whimper. You leak tears of abject horror.

You shut the door quickly behind you-- taking care to slow and keep it quiet at the last second. 

Ohhh this is bad. You&#39;re in a small bathroom-- a pedestal sink, a broken toilet with some grimy water in it, an old-school claw-footed bathtub. If it decides to check out this room, especially if it&#39;s any kind of //smart,// you&#39;re done. 

You can&#39;t hear it. You can&#39;t tell if it&#39;s coming or not. All you can do is keep quiet, and... 

Hey, there&#39;s a small window up above the toilet!! You can fit through that, easily! But you&#39;re gonna make some noise getting the old windowsill open, that&#39;s for sure... [[do you think it&#39;s worth trying to climb out?-&gt;Normal Bathroom Climb]] 

Maybe instead, you should try [[pressing your ear against the door to listen.-&gt;Normal Bathroom Fail]] It would suck if you alerted the beast to your position when there was no need to open that window... </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="138" name="Normal Bathroom Climb" tags="RG" position="2700,931" size="100,100">You wriggle yourself out of the window, pulling with your arms, and twist to sit on the sill. You&#39;re hanging outside, with your feet still in the bathroom-- //when the door comes slamming open// and you&#39;re greeted with the sight of the monster looming in the bathroom. Fuck it&#39;s like... it&#39;s like what you&#39;d imagine a werewolf to look like, for sure, but... but it&#39;s massive like a grizzly bear, all thick and room-filling. 

In a momentary panic you throw yourself back. The werewolf charges but you&#39;re already falling out the window. 

You land flat on your back on the porch-- you keep your head up, luckily. For a moment you lie there and catch your breath. You see a great big furry arm reach out the window eight feet above you, and then the big lupine snout of the beast pokes out to snarl down at you. 

You sit up and scramble backwards, pressing yourself against the porch railing. As quickly as it appeared, the werewolf withdraws and you don&#39;t hear it anymore. 

Fuck. That&#39;s not good. It obviously knows its way around the place, and... you may not have much time before it exits the house and catches up with you. You&#39;re on the side of the house; the porch wraps all the way around on all sides. If you run to your right, you&#39;ll end up at the front of the house. If you run to your left, you&#39;ll be at the back. 

You&#39;re taking a chance either way that the werewolf will meet you there. 

There is a third option though. Stretching up the side of the house is a trellis, covered in handsome ivy and colorful flowers. It looks like the kind of thing you&#39;d use to climb up and meet a sweetheart in their bedroom. And it looks sturdy enough to support your weight; good thing you didn&#39;t stop for fast food this afternoon. 

[[Run to the front of the house.-&gt;Side to FrontDoor]]

[[Head for the back porch.-&gt;Side to BackPorch]]

[[Climb the trellis to the roof.-&gt;Roof]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="139" name="Normal Bathroom Fail" tags="RG badend" position="2570,808" size="100,100">You creep to the door and lean gently against it, listening. You can&#39;t hear the footsteps... no growling or anything... it&#39;s a BIG monster, you should be able to hear it moving around, especially if it&#39;s getting closer-- 

You scream as a massive furry fist plunges straight through the door, inches from your face. It&#39;s like that scene from //The Shining// but with... a big fucking werewolf hand instead of an axe. You don&#39;t wait for Johny though, you go to plan B immediately: flinging open the window above the toilet and starting to wriggle through. 

The wraparound porch below you is a bit of a drop and you might be about to do a faceplant but it&#39;s better than-- 

&quot;FUCK NOOO!!!&quot; you scream in terror and twist back. The beast has ahold of your ankles!! Its strength is immense; its dark bulk fills the bathroom behind you. You&#39;ve got to keep pulling yourself out!!

Very quickly the monstrous werewolf shows you how futile that gesture is. You feel warmth and moisture around your feet and ankles as you try to pull yourself the rest of the way out... and when you look back you scream harder than you ever have. 

Your feet are in the monster&#39;s mouth. You give one last tug on the outsides of the window with all your strength. 

It&#39;s not enough. The werewolf slurps you backwards and catches your torso in its hands as you are pulled back from the window. You have no time to react as it lifts you high, tips its head back, and lets you slide down into its throat. Your arms are flailing around, trying to punch the creature&#39;s face, hit it in the eye, anything... 

It simply brings both hands up to clamp your arms down. One massive paw palms your face and shoves. 

And then you slide in. Horrific, powerful sucking motions gulp you down like an industrial pump. Everything goes dark; you land in a great soft fleshy back, hot and dank.

**LATER** 

You open your eyes. You&#39;re... laying on the bathroom floor? 

AND RIGHT NEXT TO YOU OH SHIT OH FUCK HELP NO you scramble backwards and press against the wall. 

Wait... that&#39;s the werewolf!! it&#39;s... sleeping?? It looks kinda... of course, you didn&#39;t get a good look at it earlier when it was EATING you, but... how are you still alive? It&#39;s laying between you and the bathroom door, snoozing peacefully like a hulking dog. 

And it has, undeniably, a rather rounded, bloated belly. Like... it&#39;s... had a meal... 

Your brain works overtime and you try to process everything. There&#39;s the werewolf, it ate you, it&#39;s stomach is very visibly full, but here you are... 

//sitting INSIDE the toilet// 

Oh no. Oh no no no. No. No please!!

**YOU ARE A FUCKING GHOST** 

You hold your hands up, you get to your feet, you inspect yourself. You still look like you&#39;ve got your original colors, but... when you try to touch things, you sort of fade into a pale glowy off-white and pass right through. 

You sink down to your knees and blue-screen. You just can&#39;t. You can&#39;t do anything but cry. 

**END** 

Y O U D I E D 

Sort of. You quickly discover the new freedoms and limitations of your undead self. You can basically move OR pass through most &quot;real&quot; items and you can even pick some of them up, throw them, knock them over... but there&#39;s this fine-motor control that you don&#39;t seem to have. Actually manipulating anything is weird. You can feel your fingers DOING what you want, but objects don&#39;t react properly. 

You can go through shit, and float around, and fade into invisibility if you want. Other ghosts can see you at all times, but to the living, you just disappear completely. It would be a lot more fun if you were, you know, STILL ALIVE!!

Too bad you didn&#39;t know you&#39;d be //sneaking around the house because some huge fucking monster showed up// when you expected GHOSTS. 

Shit, what if... what if like, Beau, or someone he&#39;s friends with or works for, planned this? Spread rumors about the mansion to get people to come so they can feed their pet or some shit? ... what kinda horror movie scenario have you gotten yourself into? 

The stairs begin to creak as you walk up. You cringe, and do your best to step slow and light. You keep checking behind you. You&#39;re about halfway up already. You nearly stumble on the step in front of you and grip the railing, then take another careful step up. Fuck, these stairs are loud. 

You glance back AND SCREAM OH FUCK ITS STANDING RIGHT THERE

It&#39;s standing at the bottom of the staircase just fucking STARING up at you like like like it&#39;s just 

You sprint up the last few steps as best as possi--IT GRABS YOUR ANKLE

You fall. You&#39;re jerked back and now you&#39;re laying on the stairs; you twist over to face it so you can actually use your arms for something. 

Whatever it is, it&#39;s a big. Damn. Furry. Beast. A werewolf-lookin&#39; thing. It blots out everything else in your vision; it&#39;s so massive. It looks like it&#39;s wearing pants, except there&#39;s HELLO, a great big tallywacker aimed in your direction. 

Before you can get over your fear and express any bewilderment, the werewolf grips you under your arms and hoists you downwards, and there&#39;s a brief moment where you thrash about before that fat schlong is stuffed into your mouth and down your throat. 

You just cant. even. fight. You can&#39;t fucking do a thing. The creature is at least four, maybe five times bigger than you are, with terrible strength and now you&#39;re... choking on its dick. Fuck, you can feel it like halfway down your throat, you sweat. You can&#39;t even SUCK if that&#39;s what it wants, the entire length is being forced into you. Like you&#39;re a fuckin&#39; blow-up doll. 

Speaking of things blowing up, after a few trivial thrusts, you feel the werewolf&#39;s dick start pulsing. It makes your entire torso throb with its powerful bursts of cum. You gag and choke and go all light-headed and can&#39;t even breathe and just... blech. Your entire existence, for a few seconds, becomes a sloppy headache of BOOSH BOOOSH BLORP BLORP GLORP and you collapse. The werewolf holds your head and body in its hands to keep you from falling away or pulling off, but there&#39;s really no need; you&#39;re too oxygen-deprived to resist at this point. 

And fuck are you ever feeling bloated all of a sudden. 

Just when you think you&#39;re going to pass out, you hear a fingersnap. &quot;Eeyy mon, put him down! The hell you be doin&#39; to a guest on mah island!&quot; an indignant female voice says. 

The werewolf shivers and cringes and you feel it pulling out of you quickly. You feel like a sock being emptied of foot. The werewolf hunches over and actually clutches at its own abdomen for a moment, and then you see its thick, furry midriff puff up with a great big //BLOOORRRP//. Its dick looks like it&#39;s pulsing with orgasm, but... nothing&#39;s coming out? 

It snarls at whoever&#39;s at the top of the stairs above you two, and then tromps off downstairs. You see its eyes gleam up at you once before it throws the front door open and lumbers out, still clutching at its self-stuffed belly. 

You roll over and gaze up at your rescuer. She&#39;s got a little doll in her hand and she&#39;s pinched its crotch. Holy crap, she made the werewolf cum INSIDE himself!!

[[&quot;Well nah. That should take care o&#39; HIM for a short while.-&gt;Alt Witch Intro]] </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="142" name="SneakDiningRoom" tags="" position="1686,686" size="100,100">You peer around the dining room. It must&#39;ve once been very opulent. You expected a crystal chandelier, but there&#39;s just a ragged few eyelets and bolts where one must have once hung. 

Sconces caked with candle wax line the walls. Everything&#39;s got such a classic, Colonial or Victorian look to it. It&#39;s quite lovely, even in its condition. You know a girl back home that would have a field day restoring this place. 

There&#39;s not much to see in here though; just chairs, a fancy old table, and lots of dust. Some candelabras that look like they were used to... do something that didn&#39;t involve providing lighting or atmosphere. Bent out of shape and destroyed. 

Up ahead is the kitchen, through an archway that looks a bit newer than the surrounding wall decor. You definitely think now would be a good time to do some proper vlogging. You can only hope the threat&#39;s gone for good, as you 
[[step into the Kitchen-&gt;KIT Vlog]] </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="143" name="Alt Witch Intro" tags="VW" position="1390,1584" size="100,100">&quot;Hmmm. Looks like ya been a bit overstuffed, mon,&quot; the mysterious woman snickers at you. &quot;If ya think you can stomach it, take a quick bite o&#39; this.&quot; 

She produces a... is that a brownie? Or a square of fudge. It&#39;s about the size of a flash drive, wrapped in plastic wrap. &quot;I make these meself for visitors who show up here and get themselves //bloated up// by some of the bayou&#39;s, shall we say, more //generous// individuals. Should help flush yeh out good.&quot; 

You unwrap it and pop the whole thing in your mouth. 

Oh. It&#39;s a pot brownie. Definitely a pot brownie. 

... or is it?? 

You swallow, and almost immediately bend over and retch. Curiously, nothing at all comes OUT of your mouth, even though you feel like you&#39;re barfing. 

And when you stagger back to your feet, you look down and realize your stomach is properly flat and firm once more, rather than all rounded n&#39; bloaty-looking. 

&quot;Bettah now, hmm?&quot; the woman says with a smirk. &quot;C&#39;mon, come wit me, we&#39;ll have a chat.&quot; She turns to walk down the hall, and you [[follow her into the room at the end.-&gt;The Study VW Intro]] </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="144" name="ClimbUp Chimney" tags="RG" position="2712,808" size="100,100">Crap. //This is so stupid, this is STUPID,// you find yourself thinking, as you peer up into the dark recess of the fireplace. You can actually see some moonlight up at the top though, and there&#39;s definitely no monsters on the roof. 

You take a long quiet breath, then pull yourself up into the chimney. Some small stones crackle and dust trickles down into the ashes of the centuries below. Hoisting yourself up isn&#39;t that difficult; the stones of the chimney are rough and provide good handholds, and it&#39;s just a wide enough space to let you fit through but also let you brace your back and legs if you need to rest. 

You&#39;re halfway up when you hear a growl down below in the living room. You make the mistake of looking down, past your legs. 

FFFUCK. There&#39;s a great big furry arm, with a huge claw-fingered hand, reaching up into the chimney. It scratches deep ruts into the darkened, softened rocks. Then it pulls back and you see the unmistakable face of a huge wolf-- or rather, a //werewolf.// Its eyes shine up at you and it snarls, showing fangs moist and ready to carve flesh. 

It reaches for you again but you&#39;re well out of its grasp. You keep climbing up. 

Soon you are at the top. You pull yourself up into the dimming evening, out of the chimney and hang from the edge before dropping down [[to the roof.-&gt;Roof]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="145" name="Side to FrontDoor" tags="RG" position="2593,1062" size="100,100">You jog around the porch to the front door, taking care to keep your footsteps light as possible, and constantly ready to turn and sprint the other direction. You approach the door and very, very slowly, peek through. 

You see the werewolf at the far end of the hall. Its great big dark figure is leaving through the back door. It disappears into the night. ... it even shuts the door behind itself. Odd. Then again if it really is a werewolf and not some crazy mutated &quot;otherwise mundane&quot; animal... it probably has human intelligence under that fur-coated surface. 

Off to the right side of the house-- your left, when facing the door-- you can see the small path leading down to the boathouse. It&#39;s hard to make out from this distance but it looks like there&#39;s still an airboat inside, floating peacefully. 

Wouldn&#39;t that mean Beau&#39;s still on the island somewhere? Hopefully the werewolf doesn&#39;t get him. And... hopefully, he&#39;s NOT the werewolf. But one of those two things seems likely. You&#39;d better get back inside while the beast is roaming around out here. 

You slip through the front door and close it quietly behind you. 

[[You&#39;re back in the hallway.-&gt;Hallway Redux]] </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="146" name="Side to BackPorch" tags="RG" position="2714,1060" size="100,100">You jog around the porch to the back door, taking care to keep your footsteps light as possible, and constantly ready to turn and sprint the other direction. You approach the door and very, very slowly, peek through. 

You see the werewolf at the far end of the hall. Its great big dark figure is leaving through the front door. It disappears into the night. ... it even shuts the door behind itself. Odd. Then again if it really is a werewolf and not some crazy mutated &quot;otherwise mundane&quot; animal... it probably has human intelligence under that fur-coated surface. 

Off in the distance, flickering vaguely in the spooky treeline, you actually see a small fire or something like it. A faint yellowy glow. You consider checking it out, but... perhaps, now that the werewolf&#39;s out of the house and //actively roaming this island,// it&#39;d be better to stay indoors for the time being. 

So you slip through the back door and close it quietly behind you. 

[[You&#39;re back in the hallway.-&gt;Hallway Redux]] </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="147" name="Roof" tags="SG" position="2846,813" size="100,100">You are high above Bayou Lourde on the roof of the mansion. It&#39;s one of those old-school deco-style roofs where it&#39;s all steep on the sides and curved kinda like a pagoda, but flat up top so people can walk around. You see some shattered pots that probably once held cute plants. Some rotten, wooden bistro furniture that&#39;s definitely going to be crushed under any weight higher than ten pounds or so. An equally rotten wood railing runs around the edges of the rooftop. Unless that werewolf knows how to climb... 

... or how to get into that fancy cupola-looking thing over there. Yep, there&#39;s a way up here from INSIDE the mansion apparently. So this spot may not be as safe as you&#39;d hoped. It&#39;s open-air; it&#39;s likely there&#39;s a spiral staircase or something, but you don&#39;t want to check it out just yet. 

Instead, you slump down for a minute to catch your breath and help your brain relax. Fuck, you&#39;re stressed. Your arms and legs are feelin&#39; that little climbing workout, too. You just need a minute. 

Down below you hear loud, yet padded footsteps in the grass around the mansion. And some growls. Sounds like the werebeast has wandered out of the house to search for you. 

You&#39;re staring up at the bright moon above, when you see some movement on the roof. Just across the way is a flickering shadow-- except it&#39;s white rather than a tone of black. Grayish pale white... ghostly. 

Hell yeah. You pull out your phone and [[head over to inspect-&gt;Roof SuicGhost]] your find. </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="148" name="Hallway Redux" tags="" position="1653,1322" size="100,100">Ok. Ok. SHIT. That was... scary. You&#39;re back in the house. You need to take a minute to calm yourself. 

You&#39;re not sure if you want to go to bed, yet. But you absolutely want to head upstairs and try to find a place to maybe, chill out for a bit. Hide, really. Just curl up for a few minutes, try to work your courage back up again. Shit! You were expecting fucking GHOSTS, not a big fucking werewolf in this stupid house! 

You catch your breath and [[head upstairs.-&gt;Upstairs Landing]] </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="149" name="Roof SuicGhost" tags="SG" position="2701,684" size="100,100">For a moment, as you view the scene before you through your phone camera and not your own eyes, you almost snort in disbelief. 

Because it looks like a bedsheet ghost. For real. Classic fuckin&#39; Caspar. Something you&#39;d see on Scooby-Doo. 

And yet... you lower your phone for just a sec and take a closer look. 

It&#39;s a wedding dress. Super old-school, obviously. Massive and bushy and frilly. Only once you take a few steps closer do you see the ghostly woman wearing it materialize inside. 

She doesn&#39;t look at you. She has that almost typical &#39;Southern Belle&#39; ringlets hair, you&#39;ve seen it plenty of times in movies and stuff. She&#39;s crying. 

She&#39;s distraught. You get as close as you dare. You keep your phone recording her at all times. 

&quot;What happened?&quot; you ask in a soft voice. &quot;Why are you upset?&quot; 

She still doesn&#39;t look at you. Her face, from what you can see, is blotchy, puffy-looking. She appears to be middle-aged yet doing her best to stay as young and beautiful-looking as possible. She has runny make-up. 

&quot;Ma&#39;am?&quot; 

&quot;Just stop, just stop it Oliver!&quot; she says. Her accent is fairly light. Her voice is stronger than you&#39;d expect. &quot;I don&#39;t wanna hear no more. I&#39;ve seen enough.&quot; 

&quot;Ma&#39;am, why are you--&quot; 

She runs STRAIGHT for the edge of the roof-- and just ahead of her, the //railing is broken.// 

[[Try to stop her??-&gt;RoofVore RG]] 

There&#39;s no point in trying to save a ghost; [[stand down and watch.-&gt;RoofSG Branch]] </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="150" name="RoofVore RG" tags="SG RG badend" position="2563,551" size="100,100">&quot;Wait, don&#39;t!!&quot; you yelp as you charge after her. Can you actually save her? Is there any point to trying? Well you&#39;re gonna try. 

You catch up with her just at the rail. She teeters on the edge as you grab for her dress, and pull back. You... actually grabbed a ghost? It doesn&#39;t feel like you&#39;ve touched her at all; though your hand does sort of feel cold like you&#39;ve waved it through a misty spray of water. 

&quot;Just go, darling,&quot; she sobs, and sort of collapsed against you, her arms around your shoulders. &quot;Let me die in peace.&quot; 

&quot;Who says you have to die?&quot; you ask. &quot;Why are you so upset that you want to just end it all?&quot; 

&quot;There&#39;s no point anymore Oliver!&quot; she wails into your chest. Whoever Oliver is, she&#39;s definitely not... talking to, or about, YOU. She must be replaying a memory... perhaps the last few moments of her life. &quot;He knows about us.&quot; 

//Whoa.// What have you stumbled upon? It&#39;s like an ancient soap opera or something! &quot;Who?&quot; you ask. 

She doesn&#39;t answer your question. Her miserable face slowly looks up at you and she rubs your chest. &quot;You would... do that? On my behalf?&quot; 

&quot;... Do what?&quot; 

In that moment time seems to slow. You see her face dessicate and turn into a ghoulish mask. She clutches you. &quot;Oh Oliver. Let&#39;s fly away, then. Just like your song.&quot; 

You feel yourself yanked over the edge of the roof, and [[scream as you fall-&gt;RoofVore RG 2]]. </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="151" name="RoofSG Branch" tags="SG" position="2696,552" size="100,100">You just watch, confused, as she fades into the aether. You see a sort of... how to even describe it? If the wind were visible, and you could literally see a gust of it blow off the side of the house. You hear the cracking of wood, from straight ahead, where the railing is missing. 

And a distant echoing cry of &quot;I love you...&quot; 

You find yourself overwhelmed with sorrow. You peer over the edge, careful not to lean on the obviously weak rail. What could have possessed her to... jump? Is that what she did? Did someone push her? What have you just witnessed anyway? 

You shudder as you feel the odd wistfulness that isn&#39;t your own. Perhaps you... could&#39;ve gone with her? What would it be like, to fly with a ghost? 

You reach up and wipe your face. You, for some reason, are crying. How&#39;d that happen? You have no reason to feel sad... You blink away the tears. 

//Why&#39;d she go without you?//

And was it your fault? 

[[What if you jumped?-&gt;Unex Dark Succ]]

[[No, think happy thoughts.-&gt;ScareJumpRoof]] </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="152" name="RoofVore RG 2" tags="RG SG badend" position="2566,429" size="100,100">You whistle through the air like a bomb, shrieking in horror as you fall. It almost feels like you&#39;re falling in slo-mo, the mansion&#39;s siding racing along next to you, and down below is the deadly finish line. 

&quot;I love you, Oliver!&quot; you hear the ghost cry out. You feel as if she&#39;s hugging you, but you can&#39;t see her anymore. 

You&#39;re still screaming when you look down again and realize that you&#39;re not about to hit the ground at all: //the werewolf is standing below you// and his maw gapes open wide like the most uninviting safety net you&#39;ve ever seen. 

Your arms and legs flail about but at this point there&#39;s nothing you can do. You plunge straight down into the werewolf&#39;s mouth and your velocity makes you slide in instantly, down its throat into darkness. Your landing is muffled and you don&#39;t feel any pain, but you can tell you&#39;ve just slammed the werewolf down on its ass with your sudden presence in its belly. 

You&#39;re curled up into a ball as its stomach, a huge bag of fleshy warm walls, churns around you and compacts you. You can&#39;t stretch out or anything, you&#39;re just locked into a fetal position. All you can really do is squirm and yell. 

Outside you hear... laughter? Inside you feel heavy vibrations. And the unique sensation of enormous hands rubbing all over your back, through the werewolf&#39;s belly. &quot;Dayum!&quot; says a voice. And you know it&#39;s the beast talking; HOW it can talk is beyond you, but it&#39;s talking alright. &quot;Talk about fast food!&quot; 

and it&#39;s fucking laughing at you. 

&quot;LEMME OUT YOU BITCH!!&quot; you snarl, and do your best to thrash around and make him uncomfortable. It&#39;s Beau. It&#39;s absolutely Beau. You can tell by his voice; it&#39;s not that different than his human one, just gruffer, deeper, and louder. Sonnuvabitch! Beau ATE you!!

&quot;Nah, nah, hawhawhaw,&quot; he chuckles. You feel him tip back, possibly sitting down or leaning against something. &quot;You a delicious nutritious meal nah, smol fren. I can tell you gonna make me grow big &#39;n strong.&quot; 

&quot;I WILL GIVE YOU INDIGESTION AND EBOLA,&quot; you snap, trying to punch his innards. 

&quot;You gonna give me pecs the size of a fat girl&#39;s ass, is what you gonnna give me,&quot; Beau chortles. You feel his hands rubbing and patting you from the outside again. Bastard. &quot;You should be thankin&#39; me for bein&#39; there to catch you. Don&#39;t worry ma cher, I&#39;mma keep you nice and safe in here until you turn into beaucoup BEEFINESS for me, hawhaw.&quot; 

&quot;FUCK YOU!&quot; you yell. Beau just laughs. 

**LATER** 

You have been //swallowed// by Beau! Who is apparently a werewolf. Ain&#39;t that a bitch. You start to feel drowsy and drained pretty soon, almost like you&#39;re being hollowed out. You exhaust yourself trying to escape. Eventually you just sort of pass out. 

And then you wake up, curled up under a big willow tree on the side of the house where you fell. Whoo! You&#39;re awake and... unharmed! 

and RIGHT NEXT to Beau, who just sort of grins over at you. &quot;Mmm. Yep, figured you&#39;d be about done.&quot; 

&quot;... huh?&quot; you scoff. He doesn&#39;t make any sudden moves-- he&#39;s got a noticeably bloated gut though. Weren&#39;t you just in that big round furry ball? How&#39;d you... get out... 

&quot;Yep, yep, nngggfffff...&quot; Beau&#39;s hulking hairy werewolf form slowly pulls itself up. He yawns and belches loudly. His huge hands rub that bulging gut of his... and then you watch as it starts to shrink down. 

As it does, you can see Beau&#39;s various body parts-- arms, legs, waist, neck and shoulders-- starting to visibly throb and pulse, before pumping up with a few extra pounds of bulk here and there at random. 

He giggles. &quot;Ooo damn son, you WAS a healthy meal, fo&#39; sho.&quot; He pats his gut a few times-- it&#39;s getting less &quot;bulging round&quot; and starting to outright thicken up with some extra fat. 

When he&#39;s done, you now have a much heavier, burlier werewolf standing before you. He stretches to his full height and yawns again. &quot;You got any friends who gonna come lookin&#39; for ya?&quot; he asks. Beau picks his teeth with a claw. &quot;Mmf. Preferably more athletic types, hawhaw.&quot; 

&quot;The fuck? No!&quot; you say. &quot;I&#39;m gettin&#39; the fuck outta here and calling the motherfucking police on you--&quot; 

&quot;HAAAAAA HA HA HA HA HAAAAA...&quot; Beau holds his slightly fatter waist as he bellows with laughter. &quot;Good luck with that smol fren! Why don&#39;t you go look in the mirror at yo&#39;self?&quot; 

You look down at your hands, at your body. 

//You are pale and transparent, glowing a faint flickery white.// 

You have become a ghost. 
You scream out the biggest loudest NNNOOOO you can muster, and Beau just smirks and laughs at you. 

**END** 

You are now &quot;undead.&quot; Definitely dead, and your earthly vessel has been added to Beau&#39;s already substantial bulk-- he can hardly fit into the house anymore in his werewolf form, and when he reverts to human, he&#39;s still a great big beast of a man, at least 50 pounds heavier than when you met him earlier. 

You do seem to have all the requisite ghostly abilities pop culture has assigned: passing through things, clumsily moving objects or screwing with technology, being invisible, and just generally fucking with people-- though Beau&#39;s the only person you can ever fuck with. In fact you are unable to leave the island, as a general rule, unless you tether yourself to Beau-- which you do very frequently so you can try your damndest to haunt him, irritate him, prank him, make him miserable. There&#39;s not much he can do about it, and you discover, to a perverse sense of delight, that you have a ghostly connection to him: 

you can phase straight into his stomach, whether he&#39;s human or werewolf, and bloat him up immensely with your presence. And you can do this pretty much whenever you get close enough to him. It&#39;s enough to incapacitate him if he&#39;s human, and hinder him significantly in his beast form. You can even sort of... &quot;live there,&quot; occupying him and making him too big and heavy to do anything while you&#39;re hanging around. You can&#39;t actually possess him, but you CAN get him to do what you want by agreeing to deflate him if he obeys. 

Karma&#39;s a bitch, ain&#39;t it? It&#39;s a small consolation... but hopefully soon your friends, family, possibly subscribers-- WILL come looking for you. And when they do, you&#39;ll be able to defend them from Beau&#39;s monstrous alter-ego by turning his furry abdomen into a fucking ghost-filled ball. The jerk. </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="153" name="Unex Dark Succ" tags="SG" position="2700,428" size="100,100">How hopeless it is

How pleasant it would be to fly with the lady

to catch her as she fell

you honestly //don&#39;t matter that much// do you

All you have to do is walk to the edge, just there. Take a look. The grass and mud below is soft, and will catch you, and keep you-- 

&quot;FUCK,&quot; you snap, and you stumble backwards, nearly slipping and busting your ass. You... were you actually about to jump?? 

No, not really. It seems you were able to sort of... startle yourself out of it, by confronting those dark feelings and urges. By facing your fears. 

Fuck, though! You&#39;d better be more careful; these ghosts may be more dangerous than you thought. 

You record a quick snippet with your phone: &quot;You guys saw that right?? You saw her jump?&quot; 

Now that your heartrate is calming down again, you take some time to think things through. You&#39;ve got some decent ghost footage now, real spooky stuff. And you&#39;re pretty sure the house below is werewolf-free for the time being. Perhaps now would be a good time to head to the second floor, [[through that spiral staircase in the cupola.-&gt;Spiral Down from Roof]] </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="154" name="ScareJumpRoof" tags="RG SG" position="2829,552" size="100,100">No, nonono! Happy! You&#39;ve got to stay positive. There&#39;s no reason to jump, you&#39;ve got... you have lots of subscribers waiting to see your next video, you&#39;ve got people who love you back home, you&#39;re doing alright, not in //too// much debt... 

You walk away from the railing where she fell, the cracked and shattered wood. You head across the roof directly opposite. Even now as you look away from the site, you start to feel better. It seems some unearthly power was trying to encourage you to jump... and that&#39;s some dangerous shit. You&#39;d better be more careful around these ghosts; they might have malevolent intentions and for the first time in a long time, you start to feel a real sense of respect... and fear. For them. Because THESE ghosts are real, and the monster&#39;s real, and this house and its residents seem to want you dead. 

You look out over the swamp below, at the cypress trees, at the placid-looking water. You lean your elbows on the railing and rest your face. Just. Gotta stay happy. Sad, depressed people commit suicide. Sad, depressed people jump off roofs. She was sad. She... jumped. You won&#39;t do that. 

You hear rapid, clanging, BANGING noises coming from the cupola. Someone&#39;s climbing the stairs, it sounds like? You turn around; perhaps you&#39;re going to see the ghosts of the people who chased that woman up here, and failed to stop her... 

EXCEPT SOMEHOW IT&#39;S THE WEREWOLF having STUFFED itself through the narrow stairwell and it jumps out of the cupola and

</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="155" name="Spiral Down from Roof" tags="" position="1530,1333" size="100,100">The cupola&#39;s open-air, so you just walk around the rail to the archway that&#39;s open and head down the spiral staircase. It&#39;s creaky old iron, but holds your weight just fine. 

You descend slowly to keep things quiet. You&#39;re constantly listening to the spooky house noises all around. Little creaks, groans, drafts... 

Up ahead is a thin little hallway lined with a few candle sconces, long empty of anything that might give off light, and an ornate door. 

[[You step through.-&gt;Upstairs Landing]] </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="156" name="RoofGooEnd" tags="GOO badend" position="2831,689" size="100,100">You scream, horrified, as you plummet to the ground below. 

Your body twists in midair, up and down, end over end, the world&#39;s spinning, the ground rushes up--

you slam into something very soft and pliable and bouncy, and you sort of bounce up once, twice, and one last little third bounce... 

Is this a mattress? Your head&#39;s still spinning. You&#39;re dizzy and can&#39;t really get your bearings. What did you just land on? 

Shit. It&#39;s nice and soft. Panting hard, you let yourself flop down on it for a second. Up above, at the railing, you see the pointy-eared black shape of the werewolf looking down at you. It roars in frustration at the moon above. 

It&#39;s probably gonna come down here to get you, so you might consider sitting up and getting a move on--

You&#39;re stuck? 

You have a good look around, turning your phone&#39;s light on to see what you&#39;ve landed on. It&#39;s green, and kinda clear but hazy, like... like jello. Green jello. You thought it was a mattress, definitely, and it&#39;s angular like one-- almost like a cube? Or a big rectangle... No, straight up like gelatin. Like cheap snack-pack Jello but thicker. And... it&#39;s not sticky feeling, it&#39;s just slimy-slippery, but your hand is stuck in it? 

You wriggle your hips and put your phone in your pocket, then reach over to pull your hand free. 

Your eyes go wide as suddenly, [[your legs and ass sink into the goo beneath you.-&gt;RoofGooEnd 2]] //SLURP.// </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="157" name="RoofGooEnd 2" tags="GOO badend" position="2963,689" size="100,100">Ok... don&#39;t panic, this is just... it&#39;s just jello or something. You&#39;re kinda stuck in it but... you should be able to pull yourself out if you roll sideways and... 

PLOP. 

well fuck. That didn&#39;t work. 

And now you&#39;re laying on your side in the goop. 

You sit up-- your body isn&#39;t stuck, just everything below the waist. Your left hand is free. 

Holy crap your //shoes are dissolving!!// Fuck! This better not be some //Attack of the Blob That Ate Everything// bullshit! You thrash about and try to jerk yourself free and-- 

SCCHLLLUURP

sink in further. It&#39;s up to your bellybutton. You can pull your right hand free all of a sudden, and you try to bend forward to get your shoes off. Maybe you can save them--? Nope. You watch as they just straight up melt. Looks like an Alka-Seltzer fizzing away into a little white mess of bubbles. 

And then it starts on your jeans, from the bottoms, heading up to your knees, and then they&#39;re shorts. And it keeps. Coming. Fuck. Why. Is this fucking Jell-O cube. Taking. Your clothes off?? 

You look around, trying to see how big it is. You honestly did think it was a mattress, but you realize you&#39;re sitting like five feet off the ground or so... this thing is BIG. It&#39;s way bigger than you. If you were on your feet and a good distance away, you bet you could get away from it, outrun it. 

You cringe. You feel the goo wriggling around your navel, and then it SLURPS you down further inside. You watch your jeans fray and shred and melt into nothingness. 

You don&#39;t know what to do, but you&#39;ve got to do SOMETHING, right?? 

[[Yell for help.-&gt;RoofGooEnd 3]] Maybe the werewolf will come pull you out and... either eat you instead, or get into a fight with this goo-thing. 

[[Take a bite out of it.-&gt;RoofGooEnd 2.5]] If it wants to eat you, you&#39;re gonna make it think twice. </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="158" name="RoofGooEnd 3" tags="GOO badend" position="2965,818" size="100,100">Well THAT didn&#39;t work, and now you&#39;re up to your nips in the goop. It&#39;s sucking you in good. You can see your boxers starting to fade away, threads dissolving slowly, even the bottom of your t-shirt is looking frayed and ragged. 

The entire cube rolls in a wave towards you and suddenly you are SUCKED ALL THE WAY INSIDE. Your desperate hands stick out for one last second before being pulled in too. 

You panic and thrash about and struggle as hard as you can. It&#39;s like... extra thick water. You can barely move at all. There&#39;s no way you&#39;re going to cause this creature any pain, if it&#39;s even capable of feeling pain. Your vision is colored a hazy, marbly green; everything outside the goo is distorted by its surface. 

You CAN see everything INSIDE the slime though, quite clearly. Basically just yourself. Your increasingly naked body. The goo&#39;s just about disrobed you... just a tube-top where you once had a t-shirt... and it&#39;s GONE. 

So you&#39;re now floating naked in a great big gooey green fucking Jell-O cube. You&#39;re starting to feel very afraid. Maybe it&#39;s going to do the same thing to your body as it did to your clothes. 

Wait, how are you breathing? You&#39;re breathing! How the fuck... you just realized. You should be //drowning// right now. How... ohhh there&#39;s like an air pocket around your face... you can even see bubbles traveling too and from your head, which... suggests this cube is, well: alive, and intelligent enough to know you need to breathe... //and wants you alive.// 

For what though?? 

You soon find out when you feel a small tendril of slime poke your lips and ooze between your teeth. You try to keep it out, but... it&#39;s completely protean and just flows wherever it wants, filling any cracks, and soon your mouth is filled with it.

[[It starts to flow down your throat.-&gt;RoofGooEnd 4]] </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="159" name="RoofGooEnd 2.5" tags="GOO badend" position="3083,692" size="100,100">You dig your hand into the goo and pull up a chunk of it, and it makes no move to stop you as you put it in your mouth. 

... which might have been a very nasty death, because hey, what if it decides to melt your guts? But it doesn&#39;t. It&#39;s just... flavorless. Like celery or cucumbers or those gross fucking //LaCroix// cans.

You try to cough or force your throat shut, but all the mobile goo needs is the tiniest little hole, crack, opening possible. And it forces a small amount in, then simply forces more in to widen the gap, so it can let a steady amount of itself splash straight down your throat to land with a soft //plop// in your gut. 

Blech! It&#39;s like, bland as fuck; it wouldn&#39;t be so bad if it were flavored at least. 

Hangon, why&#39;s it fuckin&#39; FEEDING you in the first place? And why did it need to take your clothes off for that shit?? 

Ooohh OOhhh OH OHH OHHOHOOOOoooOoOOO you moan and moan and moan and moan and moan and moan and moan and no one can hear you moan and you moan and moan and WHY ARE YOU HORNY WHY IS IT GOING IN YOUR ASS WHY ARE YOU HORNY AND MOANING

You twitch and cringe and squirm as you feel it just... just //flowing.// 

GUSHING. Into your rear. FUck, you can FEel It SLOPPING into your... intestines... banging around like, hitting your inner walls, like a careless mouse in a maze... ugghhh! And you moan. You&#39;re fucking horny from it and have no idea why and you can&#39;t clench your butt shut! Every time you try, it&#39;s able to send a &#39;just tiny enough&#39; amount into your hole to widen you back up. 

It&#39;s like you&#39;re being fucked with a liquid dick that keeps shrinking and growing, except you don&#39;t have any idea what that actually feels like, so this has got to be the closest comparison. 

And then it&#39;s going in your mouth again. 

You&#39;re horny and groaning and moaning and spazzing and you arch your back and stretch and kick. 

It loves you. 

It wants to be inside you. 

All you can do is feel yourself being stuffed, and watch your belly being filled from both ends, swelling and bloating and distending. Your eyes are wide and wild and rolling. 

**END** 

You actually don&#39;t know what happened to you. 

Your eyes blink open. You&#39;ve been asleep apparently. Goodness. You&#39;re... you feel quite full. It&#39;s pleasant really. Heheh. You shiver and shudder and start cumming. Just a few spurts. Oof. Nice. 

Oh look, there&#39;s a werewolf. Sweet. 

&quot;Nah how the FUCK am I supposed to impregnate you NAH?&quot; the monster snaps, in Beau&#39;s voice, with Beau&#39;s accent. Oh look, there&#39;s a Beau. Sweet. 

You blink at him and give him a delirious smile. &quot;... s&#39;up, man,&quot; you murmur. Something wet trickles out your mouth. Might be cum, or goo. Everything feels like cum or goo. Hot, sticky, slimy. 

&quot;Did you fall right into that bitch nah?&quot; Beau the Sweet Werewolf asks. 

&quot;... fall... heheh.&quot; You moan. &quot;I feel... so good...&quot; 

&quot;Can you even //move?//&quot; Beau asks. 

&quot;Heheh. Sure.&quot; You give a little wiggle. &quot;See?&quot; Whoa. Your entire body sloshes like a water balloon. Heheh. Kinda tickles. Heh. 

&quot;Tarnation damn,&quot; Beau grumbles. He walks up to you and his werewolfy eyes glower down at you. You feel a hand on your belly OOOO that feels great. So warm and soft and nice. A great big huge hand. You emit a tiny burp. Helps ease some of the pressure. &quot;I&#39;mma have to ROLL you somewhere and get all that outta you.&quot; 

... roll? 

You make an attempt at looking down at yourself. 

Ohhhhhh. Ohh that&#39;s what... he meant. 

You&#39;re a ball. 

You&#39;re a vast, round, green-tinted human ball. Just. A ball with a head and useless  little hands and feet sticking out at odd angles. You rival a Volkswagen Beetle in size and girth. Utterly. Absolutely. Egregiously. 
Filled with goo. 

Heh. You cum again, all over the grass below. //Sweet.//</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="161" name="UnknownBreedCaptive End" tags="RG badend" position="2182,1050" size="100,100">The monstrous beast keeps you squeezed up tight-- you can breathe, but any further attempts at struggle are quickly crushed out of you, until not just your body, but your spirit feels compressed and unable to fight. 

Thankfully nothing seems broken. The monster&#39;s oddly... gentle, believe it or not. 

It sets you down on the floor, forces you onto your knees, and bends you over... in a certain, shall we say, //position.// At first you&#39;re confused, but very quickly you realize what it&#39;s about to do: you feel a claw hook into your jeans and slice a neat hole right down the crack. 

As the werewolf lowers itself over you and prepares to mount you, you choke out a sniffle. Your brain is screaming, suddenly, but nothing comes out of your mouth, and you don&#39;t attempt to fight. 

//You&#39;re getting fucked by a werewolf.// 

You sort of just shut down; your brain goes into a blue-screen of death. Or Safe Mode, perhaps. A big fat cock is crammed inside you, and you&#39;re too exhausted to do anything but pant and take it and just let it happen. 

The only consolation you get out of the whole scenario is that it&#39;s over quickly; you wince when you feel the heat blooming inside because it almost feels like you&#39;re being repeatedly punched in the gut. Within seconds you feel hot, full, //stuffed.// Like it&#39;s a hot summer day and you&#39;ve eaten too much ice cream to compensate and you&#39;re all bloated on it, except the ice cream is hot as hell too, and you&#39;re just a sweaty slick mess with a steadily growing belly starting to sag underneath you. 

Having claimed your body, the werewolf picks you up and carries you into the living room, where it curls up in front of the fire and clutches you close like a stuffed animal. 

Emphasis on //stuffed.// 

**LATER** 

When you wake up you are not in the mansion. You seem to be in some sort of little shack or something. It&#39;s early morning, birds are singing, nice yellow sunlight&#39;s glowing down outside... 

You look around the barren wooden room. There&#39;s a bag with some, hmm. Fast food in it. Burger and fries. Cup sitting next to it with some coke. 

You&#39;re definitely hungry and you gobble it up quick, but no sooner do you swallow the last fry when your stomach heaves and you unload the entire meal onto the dusty floor. Fuck. That hurt. You wipe your mouth off and curl up in a ball for awhile and try to get your brain and body working together again. You need to be able to think AND act. 

You get up and head out. You&#39;re, well, surrounded by little cabins. Something tells you they used to be houses. For slaves. 

Ugh, your stomach is like... boiling. Trying to figure out what to do with all that fucking... monster cum. Blech. You shudder at what happened. 

&quot;Oh hi,&quot; says a dopey-sounding female voice. You turn and look. Sitting just inside the door of the cabin next to yours, is a girl who looks like she&#39;s about your age. 

She also looks like she&#39;s carrying twins. 

&quot;... hi,&quot; you say. &quot;Are you like... are you stuck here? We&#39;re still on the island, right? In Bayou Lourde?&quot; 

&quot;Mmm... yep,&quot; she smiles, looking dreamy. &quot;He got another boy this time I see. A //cute// boy. Heheheh.&quot; 

&quot;Uhh...&quot; you blush a little. &quot;The, uhh. Werewolf?&quot; 

&quot;Mmmmm yyyeah. Isn&#39;t he a //hunk,//&quot; she says. It strikes you that she may have SEVERE Stockholm Syndrome. She rubs her... her belly. Very very pregnant. Very big and bulgy and tight-looking. 

Your eyes widen in horror. &quot;Did... he, uhh...&quot; 

&quot;Mmm he //ravished// me,&quot; she titters. She rolls back flat on her back, belly sticking up in the air. &quot;Look how //pregnant// he made me.&quot; 

&quot;I, uhh, I&#39;m gonna go get help?&quot; you say, very unnerved by her mannerisms. And you wander away. 

&quot;I wonder how pregnant he made //you,//&quot; she cooes quietly. You barely hear her, but it makes you shiver just the same, and then you see [[something moving in another slave cabin.-&gt;UnknownBreedCaptive 2]] </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="162" name="UnknownBreedCaptive 2" tags="RG badend" position="2312,1049" size="100,100">Your legs go weak and you have to grip the cabin&#39;s doorframe to steady yourself. 

There is a man inside, looks to be late thirties or so, needs a shave and a shower for sure. There&#39;s a shackle around his ankle and an old-school ball-n-chain apparatus... That&#39;s the first thing you notice. 

The second thing you notice is that he&#39;s... very, very fat. Or rather he&#39;s got, strong-looking arms and legs, and otherwise looks lean, but has this great big... um. Beer gut. Like. Like he&#39;s guzzled an entire keg. 

The third thing you notice is probably the worst thing. 

He&#39;s wearing a tattered police uniform. 

He&#39;s even got the utility belt, but all his gear&#39;s missing. The shirt&#39;s split wide open to let his great big... fat, obviously-a-beer-gut... hang out. 

&quot;S&#39;not polite to stare,&quot; he says in a deep drawl, without really looking your way. 

&quot;I... I&#39;m sorry?&quot; you say. 

&quot;Heh.&quot; Finally he looks at you with his baleful, defeated eyes. He looks up up and down. &quot;Fresh catch, looks like. Here I was hopin&#39; you&#39;d be the cavalry.&quot; 

&quot;I&#39;ve got a phone, I can call for help, and my car&#39;s just a short boat ride... over...&quot; you feel like your heart implodes with fresh fear. 

Your smartphone&#39;s missing. 
So&#39;s your wallet. So&#39;s anything else you had in your pockets. 

&quot;Yeah, yeah,&quot; the cop nods. He&#39;s just sitting there in a heap on the floor of the cabin. His belly takes up like, his entire torso almost. &quot;Took all my shit too. Thought he was just a dumb hick.&quot; 

&quot;Who?&quot; 

&quot;Beau.&quot; 

You run your fingers through your hair. 

&quot;He&#39;s a //rougarou,// kid,&quot; the guy says. His hands come up to lift his heavy-looking gut up so he can shift his weight. He sighs. &quot;And we&#39;re... his now.&quot; 

&quot;His... what? What does that even mean?&quot; 

&quot;HIS,&quot; the officer says with a little more vehemence. &quot;Whatchu think it means? Don&#39;t act like he didn&#39;t fuck you too, I see that little belly you got growin&#39;.&quot; 

&quot;I...&quot; you blush and clutch at yourself, embarrassed. &quot;I, uhh, he... it... it&#39;s just cum,&quot; you mutter lamely. 

The cop starts laughing. &quot;Yeah. Yeah yeah. Right. That&#39;s what I thought too,&quot; he says. He points down at himself. &quot;Guess what, kid.&quot; 

No. Nonono. No. NO. You refuse to believe it. You back out of the cabin and nearly jump out of your skin; the young women with the pregnant belly grabs you with a pair of gentle hands and rubs //your// stomach. &quot;Mmmm,&quot; she says. [[&quot;I wonder how many //you&#39;re// carrying...&quot;-&gt;UnknownBreedCaptive 3]] </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="163" name="UnknownBreedCaptive 3" tags="badend RG" position="2448,1052" size="100,100">You shove her off and run fast, through the row of cabins, round the corner, towards the mansion you can see through the trees. You pant hard; you&#39;re still... fuck, you just feel //drained// from what happened last night, and then you puked and you&#39;re still hungry and low on fuel and... 

shit, this SUCKS. 

You use the mansion to orient yourself and you find the boathouse pretty quickly; it&#39;s just down that little path over there. You pull the boathouse door open and-- 

There he is. There&#39;s Beau, sitting there refueling his airboat. 

He smirks over at you. &quot;Well good mornin&#39;, nah. Where&#39;d you think you&#39;re goin&#39;?&quot; 

&quot;I&#39;m getting off this island.&quot; 

&quot;Ohoho. Hawhaw. Haw. Not while you carryin&#39; my babies you ain&#39;t,&quot; Beau says. He screws the gas cap back on and sets the cannister down, turning to face you on his little stool. &quot;But don&#39;t worry. I&#39;ll take reeeeel good care of you,&quot; he says. 

&quot;I am NOT STAYING HERE--&quot; 

&quot;Well... I mean I s&#39;pose you can try swimmin,&#39; if you like your odds,&quot; Beau shrugs. He gestures towards the water just outside the boathouse. &quot;They don&#39;t come up here on land much, I keep &#39;em away pretty good by markin&#39; my territory proper. But the water&#39;s theirs.&quot; 

You squint. Sure enough, there are at least four adult alligators lying just beneath the surface of the murky water. You can see their eyes, and those logs you thought were logs? Aren&#39;t logs. They&#39;re big reptilian bodies that can fit you inside, easy. 

&quot;What do you WANT with me,&quot; you whisper, furious. 

Beau sighs and claps his hands on his knees, then stands up. &quot;I need, from you and others, to help keep my breedin&#39; urges under control.&quot; He walks over to you and you make a small attempt to back out the door, but he&#39;s already got an arm around your shoulder and is steering you towards the house. &quot;If I don&#39;t impregnate SOMEONE when //Le Rougarou// wants to mate, he gon&#39; keep comin&#39; out every night. How&#39;m I suppose to live a normal life as a respectable citizen, if I keep turnin&#39; into a great big hairy beast every night?&quot; 

&quot;So hire HOOKERS??&quot; you snap, trying to throw his arm off you. 

He just squeezes you tight against his body, lifting you off the ground for a second. &quot;Well I tried that, but that gets expensive after a few days. So. I just thought I&#39;d bring some people around and knock &#39;em up. See if they like it. Some do, and I let &#39;em go or stay as they please, like lil&#39; Miss LeRouge over there? You already met her yet? She LOVE to be havin&#39; my pups.&quot; 

Beau&#39;s other hand, strong and large and rough, slides down your chest and feels your abdomen. &quot;If you just cooperate nah, and make sure I get some nice healthy strong pups from you, I&#39;ll let you go in... ehh. In good time. You be back on the Internet soon, talkin&#39; all &#39;bout your ghosts n&#39; shit.&quot; 

&quot;But if you try to escape,&quot; Beau says, and his voice goes very dark and menacing suddenly, &quot;I&#39;mma keep you. LONG time. You gonna end up like Officer McBreeder with a short leash on.&quot; 

You squirm at his touch. &quot;... his name&#39;s McBreeder?&quot; 

&quot;Well he done tried to escape three motherfuckin&#39; times, so that&#39;s his name NOW!&quot; Beau chortles. He gives your tummy a pat. &quot;You though, I forsee you givin&#39; me plenty healthy nice pups, so I don&#39;t think you&#39;ll be a problem. Lookee there, you already startin&#39; to show for me.&quot; 

You look down. 

To your chagrin, you... you&#39;ve bloated. Like slightly more. Than you were before, like when you woke up you were basically flat or otherwise back to normal... but now?  
Fuck, it looks like just... a tiny little weight gain, maybe? Like you had a big meal? Which you DID, but then puked it up, and it&#39;s been hours since he... fucked you... with all that cum... 

&quot;No... nonononono!!&quot; you squeal as you watch your belly roll and puff up a little bit more. 

Beau picks you up and hugs you close. &quot;Yep. You a nice FERTILE little bro. You gonna gimme the //beaucoup// babies, I guarantee.&quot; 

**END** 

You have been CAPTURED by Beau, the Rougarou. 

You are now pregnant and will spend your days swelling with life, a captive breeder on this little island deep in the middle of Bayou Lourde. Whenever thoughts of escape cross your mind, you have only to look over at Officer... McBreeder. Who Beau keeps //permanently// pregnant with as many pups as he can cram into the poor man. 

Of course you, too, feel like you&#39;re permanently pregnant. As the weeks turn into months, you feel like you get barely any time at all between squeezing out cute little werewolf pups, and having more of them packed inside your increasingly-stretchy body. 

You have no idea how many pups Beau wants you to bear for him. 
Or, hell, //how your male anatomy can even get pregnant in the first place.// And Beau won&#39;t explain that. He just makes vague comments about his virility or the monster being such a big beast that you don&#39;t have any choice BUT to get pregnant when you get fucked... 

Your only hope is holding out for either someone to come looking for you, or for Beau to decide he&#39;s gotten enough use out of you.
And who knows when that will be? </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="164" name="BeauFail Reason Base" tags="RG" position="1170,596" size="100,100">Without another word you race downstairs. 

&quot;... well, suit yourself I guess. Nice knowin&#39; ya,&quot; Beau shrugs. &quot;Coulda had some drinks an&#39; some fun with me up here but you gonna be... what they call it now? Species-ist? You know, like &#39;racist&#39; but with species?&quot; 

He rambles on above you but his voice fades, and he does NOT follow you down though you half-expect him to. You can only think of two possible reasons why a ten-foot-tall, likely six-or-seven hundred pound huge-ass werewolf wouldn&#39;t want to come down here: 

A) He&#39;s superstitious and there&#39;s like weird ghosts down here, which is EXACTLY what you came here to see in the first place... 

or... 

or B) There&#39;s something down here that&#39;s shaken his confidence in his monstrous bulk, perhaps something that&#39;s beaten him in a fight before... 

So what could scare such a huge beast? Or at least, scare the man inside the fur coat? 

Well you&#39;re down here now, so, [[you&#39;ll likely find out soon.-&gt;The Basement]] Time to explore the Basement! </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="165" name="BeauSucc Reason Base" tags="RG" position="905,439" size="100,100">&quot;... why, what&#39;s down there?&quot; you ask. 

&quot;Well let&#39;s just say if you&#39;re arachnophobic, you might just wanna stay up here with me.&quot; Beau lurches closer, grinning wide to show all his fangs. &quot;Maybe we can //cuddle.// I&#39;m a GOOD cuddler.&quot; 

&quot;I think I can handle a few fuckin&#39; spiders,&quot; you scoff. You take a step down. 

&quot;Ohh no, there&#39;s only one spider right now,&quot; Beau says. He chuckles and hunches forward-- it almost looks like he&#39;s coiling to pounce, so you tense up and prepare to duck under him if he does. &quot;She wanna make MORE spiders though. And she like to grab people, tie you up with webs, and...&quot; he shudders. You can see his huge muscles ripple and twitch all over. &quot;It&#39;s nasty, smol fren. I seen it done once before. If you gonna let any creature pump you fulla babies, it might as well be me; I&#39;m soft and fuzzy and will keep you plenty safe, I guaran//tee.//&quot; 

&quot;Yeah I don&#39;t think ANYONE&#39;s gonna, uhh, &#39;pump me fulla babies&#39; anytime soon--&quot; 

Behind you there is a loud impatient SCRREEEEE and you turn to see many long hairy spider legs reach up from the darkness. You scream, and scramble back up the stairs, and then you feel a pair of enormous hands wrap around your body and lift you out of the stairwell. 

You tumble backwards on your rear end, and when you manage to right yourself, you see the big werewolf slamming the door shut. &quot;GIT yo fat spidery-ass back down in there. Wait until I find you some scumbag lawyer or politician, THEN you can lay yo&#39; eggs,&quot; Beau snaps at the closed door. 

He turns to you. &quot;Don&#39;t worry. She won&#39;t come up here. She don&#39;t like any sorta lights. You alright?&quot; 

Your heart&#39;s pounding. If you weren&#39;t arachnophobic before, you might be now. That sucker was... close to Beau&#39;s size, to be honest. It was dark, sure, and you could barely see her full figure, but holy shit NOPE. 

&quot;C&#39;mere, I&#39;ll show you &#39;round the place good &#39;n proper,&quot; Beau says. 

He holds out a massive claw-fingered hand to you-- it&#39;s entirely non-malicious, like... he&#39;s no longer trying to scare you. He seems geniune. 

So you take his hand, and he [[helps you to your feet.-&gt;Chillin&#39; With RGBeau]] </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="166" name="Chillin&#39; With RGBeau" tags="RG" position="911,309" size="100,100">How very... unexpected, though pleasantly surprising, that all you had to do was try to //reason// with the hulking great monster next to you in order to befriend him. Beau seems perfectly in control of himself; a far cry from any fictional werewolf depiction you&#39;ve ever seen. 

He takes you on a nice, easy-paced walking tour of the house, showing off all the rooms on the first floor. You catch a glimpse of a few ghosts, but only when you go upstairs does Beau get more defensive of you. He growls when he senses one particular ghost approaching. 

&quot;I can&#39;t fight this one off right now,&quot; he says ominously. And he picks you up like a baby and holds you close in his massive arms. &quot;We gon&#39; have to do the upstairs tour in the morning. C&#39;mon down, I&#39;mma get you somethin&#39; to drink and we can talk.&quot; 

You don&#39;t see any ghosts, but you definitely feel... some kind of presence. Beau carries you back downstairs very quickly and outside the house. 

Across the plantation island, about a minute&#39;s walk from the house at an easy pace, there&#39;s a nice little cabin with a small dock out back for fishing or rowboating. It&#39;s a lot newer and better-kept than the mansion itself-- still fairly primitive, but it&#39;s clean and cozy. Beau produces some very classic-looking, &quot;XXX&quot; branded jugs. &quot;Here, made this myself-- take it slow though, or you&#39;ll probably melt into a puddle o&#39; swamp goo.&quot; 

You sip from the jug of shine; FUCK it&#39;s strong, you blink and shiver and smirk down at it. &quot;Wow. Uh. Ok then.&quot; 

&quot;Well nah.&quot; Beau chugs from his own jug. &quot;If you got questions, might as well ask while you&#39;re still awake.&quot; 

Hmm. You drink some more. It&#39;s spicy and good and kicks like a fuckin&#39; horse. You realize it&#39;s calmed you down significantly from your encounter with the giant spider in the basement. 

So what do you want to ask him? 

[[&quot;So what&#39;s it like bein&#39; a werewolf?&quot;-&gt;CWB RG Q]] 

[[&quot;Why do you live on this island in the middle of nowhere?&quot;-&gt;CWB BL Q]] 

[[&quot;The fuck&#39;s up with that huge fucking spider??&quot;-&gt;CWB HS Q]] 

[[&quot;How many ghosts live here?&quot;-&gt;CWB GP Q]] </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="167" name="CWB RG Q" tags="RG" position="744,131" size="100,100">&quot;Aww //son,//&quot; Beau smirks proudly. &quot;I&#39;mma tell you, lemme tell you this: I was NOT happy, at first, to be a //rougarou.// But I learn to love it right quick nah, y&#39;hear?&quot; He gets up and flexes his muscles like a bodybuilder. &quot;Look at this. Look how huge. It&#39;s the best. I can lift everything and I can run damn-fool-fast and I ain&#39;t afraid of... much at all. But most things is afraid of //me,// hawhaw.&quot; 

&quot;Is //rougarou// like, French for &#39;werewolf&#39;?&quot; you ask after another drink of shine. His posing and showing off is definitely making you feel absolutely tiny. There&#39;s no way you&#39;d ever be that strong, or that big. What incredible presence! 

&quot;Well uhh... it&#39;s French //Cajun,// ma cher,&quot; Beau smiles. He sits back down on the bed, massive legs spread wide, leaning against the wall casually. &quot;So sorta, yeah.&quot; 

&quot;Are there like other monsters hanging around here too?&quot; you ask. Hot damn, this here moonshine is //hella// powerful. At least you feel at ease with the sight of the monster sitting barely two feet from you in this tiny little wooden cabin with nowhere to run. 

&quot;... there might be,&quot; Beau says with a knowing grin. &quot;But hey, you with me nah. I&#39;mma keep you safe from them. Just don&#39; go runnin&#39; off, y&#39;hear?&quot; 

&quot;Right, right,&quot; you nod. Some more moonshine makes you tingle and shiver all over, pleasantly so. &quot;Uh... so can you like //turn other people// into werewolves? And does it hurt? And do you gotta like eat people every time you turn? And--&quot; 

&quot;Whoa, whoa nah, slow down just a bit smol fren,&quot; Beau chuckles with his hands up. &quot;My muscles may be bigger but my brain ain&#39;t much, so gimme a sec to answer all that &#39;fore I get all confused. Uhhm. Ok. So yeah, a rougarou CAN turn someone else into one-- but then he&#39;ll pass it on. So if I bite you, for example, I&#39;mma turn back human for good, while you transform. Unless you bite me back, then it&#39;s like, hot potato. Hawhawhaw!&quot; 

Ohh. That&#39;s neat. So it&#39;s... not like a spreading disease, more like a curse that gets passed on to the next person. 

&quot;Anyway, well.&quot; Beau slumps forward on the bed with his elbows on his knees, and his head in his hands. &quot;Hmm. It... don&#39;t really hurt? Unless it&#39;s happening because you ain&#39;t been feedin&#39; the big guy. Then it hurt IF you try to stop the change. Which, you can? But it&#39;s gonna hurt bad. And if you stop tryin&#39; to hold it in, you pretty much just... explode into the beast and go on a rampage. Gobble up whoever&#39;s closest. So it&#39;s best to stay in control and keep things managed, you know, like a responsible adult.&quot; He chuckles at himself. 

[[&quot;So that spider in the basement... are you like afraid of it or something?&quot;-&gt;CWB HS Q]] 

[[&quot;I bet you know all about the ghosts in the house, right?&quot;-&gt;CWB GP Q]] 

[[&quot;Wait, so... do you HAVE to eat people?&quot;-&gt;CWB DC Q]] 

[[&quot;So wait, if it&#39;s traded by a bite, then how long have you been a werewolf and like, who bit you and stuff?&quot;-&gt;CWB TF Q]] </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="168" name="CWB BL Q" tags="RG" position="625,277" size="100,100">&quot;Well you see nah,&quot; Beau says after chugging some more booze. &quot;This here island got a reputation for bein&#39; spooky. One of those places people sometimes don&#39;t come back from. 

&quot;So, most people stay away. Police and other authorities don&#39;t usually come snoopin&#39; round, neither. And as you can clearly see...&quot; he stands up for a sec and fills the cabin with his presence, proudly puffing himself up and showing off his immense, muscular monster body. &quot;I got me a monster-side to take care of, and attractin&#39; too much attention to the big guy here, is gonna end bad.&quot; 

&quot;I mean how do you NOT attract attention,&quot; you chuckle, sippin&#39; your shine. &quot;You&#39;re like what, ten feet tall? You&#39;re kinda hard to miss.&quot; 

&quot;Well normally I don&#39;t look like THIS, hawhawhaw...&quot; Beau sits back down. &quot;But yeah. The isolation out here means that when people DO come &#39;round for a visit, I can keep the beast satisfied for a nice long time.&quot; He leers at you, which makes you quiver, and you drink some more moonshine to pretend like you&#39;re not a little nervous this close to a grizzly-bear-sized talking predator. 

[[&quot;... do you... you gotta eat people?-&gt;CWB DC Q]] 

[[&quot;... so what&#39;s it like? Bein&#39; all... big &#39;n fuzzy?&quot;-&gt;CWB RG Q]]

&quot;Did you ever have to fight her?&quot; You sip your moonshine. 

&quot;Ehh, not really a //fight,// but you ain&#39;t the only person I stopped her from... impregnatin&#39;.&quot; 

Your stomach turns over. Ugh. UGH. &quot;Eww... like //Aliens//?&quot; you ask, taking another swig. Shoot, this&#39;s some heady-damn BOOZE now... 

&quot;... Well she don&#39;t KILL you, they don&#39;t rip you open when they come out, as far as I know,&quot; Beau says. He leans back on the bed in the corner of the cabin. It&#39;s far too small for his incredible bulk, but apparently it&#39;s quite sturdy, because you don&#39;t even hear it creaking under his weight. 

&quot;Nahh,&quot; he continues with a shake of his head. &quot;It&#39;s just a sad sight, to see a poor brudda or sweet lil&#39; lady all... webbed-up and swollen into a big human ball with a buncha nasty spiders.&quot; 

You shiver. &quot;... couldn&#39;t you just kill the damn thing?&quot; 

&quot;Well shoot, son! She just tryin&#39;a get laid, nah!&quot; Beau chortles. &quot;Ain&#39;t we all about the same thing? Besides... I get a kick outta takin&#39; her //victims// from her. Pisses her off when I //impregnate// y&#39;all myself.&quot; 

You swallow a bit more booze than you intended. Whooo boy, it&#39;s gettin&#39; to ya already. 

[[&quot;... uhh... &#39;impregnate&#39;?&quot;-&gt;CWB IMP Q]] 

[[&quot;... uhh... so what about all the ghosts here?&quot;-&gt;CWB GP Q]] 

[[&quot;... uhh... so, bein&#39; a werewolf. What&#39;s **hic** that like?&quot;-&gt;CWB RG Q]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="170" name="CWB GP Q" tags="RG" position="871,154" size="100,100">&quot;Ohh, the ghosts? Hmm, lemme see,&quot; Beau ponders awhile. &quot;I know there&#39;s... hmm. So there&#39;s the invisible one upstairs. He don&#39;t bother me, but anyone who goes upstairs at night without protection? Gonna probably end up with a ghost baby in their belly.&quot; Beau&#39;s eyes get big for a second. &quot;//Even// if you a man. So be careful after dark up there.&quot; 

You nearly gag on your next sip of shine, but keep it down. You&#39;ve got no reason to assume he&#39;s lying to you, so you appreciate the warning. 

&quot;Uhh, let&#39;s see... the original owner of the place is still here too,&quot; Beau says. &quot;The big man himself, he got a room upstairs that he never leaves... and don&#39;t let anyone in, either. It&#39;s always locked and I can&#39;t even bust the door down. I never seen him, but I definitely hear him callin&#39; for Mammy Vi sometimes.&quot; 

&quot;Heheh. I met her already.&quot; You giggle and take a long drink. 

&quot;Hey, she gonna be the nicest ghost around here, I guarantee,&quot; Beau says, &quot;but you still gotta be careful. One time I let her feed me some-a her ghostly lil biscuits &#39;n shit? Next thing I know I&#39;m on my back with a muh-fuckin&#39; gut look like I crammed three whole people inside. And then!&quot; he laughs and takes a drink, &quot;and then the next day, as I turned back human, I digested it all at once. Let&#39;s just say, I lost my fur and my big //rougarou// muscles, but... stayed about the same weight.&quot; 

You laugh, and drink. 

&quot;There&#39;s a few other ghosts on the island you might run into while you&#39;re here,&quot; Beau shrugs, &quot;but... those gonna be the most important. Best keep in mind: don&#39;t go in the kitchen if you ain&#39;t starvin&#39; to death, don&#39;t go upstairs after dark, and uhh... don&#39;t go up on the roof alone. That bitch up there, she&#39;ll make you feel like life ain&#39;t worth livin&#39;, and you&#39;ll look around and realize you&#39;re about four stories up in the air...&quot; he shakes his head. 

You nod, taking it all in. You&#39;ve got more questions of course. 

[[&quot;So what are you doing here on this ghost-infested island, anyway?&quot;-&gt;CWB BL Q]]

[[&quot;Bein&#39; a werewolf&#39;s gotta be kinda cool though, right? What&#39;s that like?&quot;-&gt;CWB RG Q]] 

[[&quot;What about the... spider-thing, in the basement?&quot;-&gt;CWB HS Q]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="171" name="CWB IMP Q" tags="RG" position="638,417" size="100,100">&quot;Mm-hmm,&quot; Beau nods, &quot;so sometimes, //Le Rougarou,// he //beacoup// hungry, y&#39;hear? But othertimes, he //beacoup HORNY.// And nice lil frens like yourself. When you come &#39;round here to visit.&quot; Beau cuddles you close. 

You actually kinda lean into it. Hey, he feels //nice!// And you&#39;re... drunker than you intended to be. Mmmf. He&#39;s soft, warm, absolutely huge... you felt threatened earlier, but now you actually kinda feel, maybe, safe? This close to him? 

&quot;Mmmm.&quot; Beau&#39;s arm around your shoulders squeezes you into his body. &quot;See here&#39;s the thing.&quot; He belches loudly, then continues. &quot;Life. Life is AAALLL &#39;bout fuckin&#39;. I ain&#39;t no proper philosopher, but. You know how much thing in life, all ends up bein&#39; about fuckin&#39; and makin&#39; babies? Spreadin&#39; your oats?&quot; 

You nod. You grab your jug-- or maybe it was his, you&#39;re not sure anymore. &quot;Mmm-hmm,&quot; you mumble. &quot;Sure is, ain&#39;t it.&quot; 

&quot;Why, for example, why you think any man put hisself through some, bullshit hard job, kissin&#39; some rich bastard&#39;s chonky ass in a fancy suit, if not to make money and get a sweet lil lady to marry up with him. So he can get laid, and then comes the babies.&quot; Beau hiccups. &quot;And roun&#39; these here parts, ain&#39;t no different. That ghost upstairs? That spider down below? Me, Le Rougarou? Shoo, nah. There&#39;s even some other ghosts &#39;n shit round the island. Don&#39; live in the house, but if you go find &#39;em, I guarantee they wanna...&quot; 

he belches, and then his hands clasp around your middle and you feel him nuzzling the top of your head. &quot;They wanna just. Fill you right up. Make you big &#39;n round.&quot; 

You grin. His hands feel nice. You giggle slightly as you imagine yourself being big &#39;n round. &quot;But. You&#39;re... you&#39;re like, my BIG BUDDY, right?&quot; you say. 

&quot;Yep. Yep. Sho&#39; am.&quot; Beau sniffs your hair, pats your head. Rubs your abdomen. 

Pulls your shirt off. 
[[Licks your face, like the big horny werewolf he is.-&gt;CWB Impregnation]] </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="172" name="CWB DC Q" tags="RG" position="609,151" size="100,100">&quot;Well hell yeah!&quot; Beau guffaws. &quot;Hahah! Haw, haw... How you think I got so big anyway? Only way to grow up big &#39;n strong is to get lots of nutritious meals, nah.&quot; He reaches out and pulls you close before you can do or say anything else, and his mighty arm clamps you to his side. His other arm flexes up in front of you. 

His fuckin&#39; biceps is like... bigger around than your entire thigh. Your head. Shit. It&#39;s scary how big he is. And this close, he&#39;s in total control; he can do whatever he wants to you and you&#39;ve got no say in the matter... 

&quot;You see that? That don&#39; come from bein&#39; a wussy-ass vegan hippie,&quot; Beau snickers. &quot;O&#39; course, I can keep //le rougarou// satisfied for awhile with just regular food. Or even some &#39;o Mammy Vi&#39;s GHOST food... but her food nah, that&#39;ll fatten you right up but QUICK.&quot; He pats his midriff, which you notice isn&#39;t exactly //fat,// but he doesn&#39;t have a shredded six pack either. Kinda full-figured and padded, though just as firm as the rest of him. &quot;I&#39;m still workin&#39; off the last time I let her stuff me too full, hawhawhaw.&quot; 

You quiver, and take a big gulp from your jug to calm your nerves. Primal instincts are screaming at you to run, but... it&#39;s like, where the fuck would you go? Nowhere, that&#39;s where. Not with his gigantic arm cuddling you close to his... big, warm, furry body. Mmm. His fur is fuckin&#39; SOFT, like for real. 

&quot;So... what about me though?&quot; you ask. 

&quot;Oh you want me to eat you?&quot; Beau gives you a little shake, grinning down at you. 

&quot;I&#39;d prefer if you didn&#39;t!&quot; 

&quot;You look like a plenty-good snack though,&quot; Beau says. 

Oh shit. &quot;Uhh. Uhh. I will... give you diarrhea.&quot; 

&quot;Mmm,&quot; Beau rubs your chest and stomach with his huge hand, and ruffles your hair. &quot;Only thing you&#39;ll give me is extra pounds of beefcake, I guarantee... and then the only thing you&#39;ll pop out as...&quot; 

Ohh FUCK FUCK FUCK he&#39;s picking you up!! He holds you high in the air in front of his face, leering up at you. &quot;... is a cute lil ghost to haunt the island with all the other ghosts. Nah c&#39;mon in here smol fren.&quot; 

There&#39;s just. Nothing. At all. You can do. 

[[Beau shoves you into his mouth headfirst, pushes you down his throat,-&gt;CWB VO]] and just like that you slide down into his belly. </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="173" name="CWB VO" tags="RG" position="478,150" size="100,100">&quot;Heheh. Damn you tasty as FUCK,&quot; Beau chuckles outside. His voice emanates from everywhere, it seems, though it&#39;s muffled by his... fleshy walls. &quot;Heheheh. Haw haw haw. Hawhaw. Got me lookin&#39; plenty pregnant, even though you a lil&#39; smol fren.&quot; Something pats your back a few times. 

You&#39;re upside down, or some-side-up, in a dark, moist, hot bag that squishes and flexes all around you. &quot;Beau! Beau c&#39;mon man, don&#39;t do this please!!&quot; 

&quot;Aww, you don&#39; wanna help fatten me up some?&quot; he laughs. &quot;I been thinkin&#39; if I put some extra weight on, Mammy Violette&#39;ll stop tryin&#39; to do it for me with her ghost-ass-cookin&#39;, every time I pass by the kitchen.&quot; 

&quot;Please man don&#39;t //kill// me!&quot; you cry, actual tears. &quot;Or at least fucking... kill me QUICK first so I don&#39;t gotta feel myself being FUCKING DISSOLVED!!&quot; 

&quot;Ohh. OHH that&#39;s what you&#39;re worried about?&quot; Beau asks. &quot;That ain&#39;t quite how it works, far as I can tell. My, uhh, interior anatomy, it&#39;s a lil different than most normal beasts. Seein&#39; as how I&#39;m a mythological creature an&#39; all. If I go ahead and digest you, it won&#39;t hurt, you&#39;ll just sorta fall asleep nice an&#39; peaceful--&quot; 

&quot;Just lemme out!!&quot; you beg. 

&quot;Wait wait wait wait,&quot; Beau says, starting to laugh some more. &quot;I got a good idea. Gonna help you relax some.&quot; 

You feel... a combination of his massive hands, and some very powerful stomach muscle movement, forcing you to roll upwards and holding you in place. There&#39;s a sort of flexing hole that you can barely see in front of your face-- the bottom of his throat? The stomach shoves you upwards towards it, and... and then your mouth is like, ON it. You can&#39;t move your head, turn your face, or close your mouth, and now there&#39;s just this firm muscular... like a nozzle, almost. Keeping your mouth open. 

Beau&#39;s throat pulses above you, undulating down towards you, and then //fucking moonshine// spills into your mouth. You fill up quick and have no choice but to swallow, or you&#39;ll stop breathing! 

&quot;There we go. How&#39;s that? How &#39;bout some more?&quot; 

&quot;Wait wait--&quot; is all you can manage before you have to take a deep breath and let yourself be forcefed more booze. 

......... this goes on for a few more minutes. You just... you have to go limp and let it happen; there&#39;s no point in even trying to resist. You&#39;re sloshy and full and bubbly and... three sheets to the wind. You suddenly don&#39;t even care that you&#39;re sitting in a werewolf&#39;s stomach... drinking booze that he swallowed himself. 

But it&#39;s kinda nice when he rubs his gut, rubbing you by proxy. &quot;There we go. Hey you know what though, you drinkin&#39; all my shine, hawhaw!&quot; Every time he laughs, you feel like a salt shaker over a pile of french fries. &quot;C&#39;mere, let&#39;s get you up outta there.&quot; 

Suddenly all around yourself, you feel the walls of his stomach pushing you up, HARD. You giggle and your head lolls, and your arms fold down against your sides, and suddenly you see light and you&#39;re falling and you [[land in Beau&#39;s hands, gazing up at him with a big stupid smirk on your face.-&gt;CWB VO Stop]] </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="174" name="CWB VO Stop" tags="RG" position="507,284" size="100,100">&quot;Hawhaw. See? Wasn&#39;t so bad.&quot; Beau ruffles your hair up. 

You feel kinda slimy all over but you&#39;re a lot drier than you expected to be. You sigh and lay back in his giant hand. &quot;Scared the shit outta me.&quot; 

&quot;Nnnaaahhh...&quot; Beau shrugs. &quot;If I ate you, all your Internet peeps gonna come lookin&#39; for me wonderin&#39; where you are. Not sure I want that kinda publicity, smol fren.&quot; He rubs his chin. &quot;Though... I bet I could get a bunch of &#39;em pregnant, if they didn&#39;t come too many at a time...&quot; 

You try to focus your eyes; your vision&#39;s pretty fuzzy and the world&#39;s moving all laggy and slow. [[&quot;Whatcha mean... **burp** pregnant?-&gt;CWB IMP Q]] </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="175" name="CWB TF Q" tags="RG" position="768,283" size="100,100">&quot;You know... it&#39;s a funny thing.&quot; Beau rubs his chin, and leans sideways with a far-off look in his eyes. &quot;I don&#39;t remember, for the life of me, when I turned, or... much about my life at all before I became a //rougarou.// But all the legends say that if you get bit by one, you become one, and he gets to be human again.&quot; 

&quot;But like... how are they MADE?&quot; you ask. &quot;I mean what came first, the chicken or the egg?&quot; 

&quot;... you mean like... babies??&quot; Beau chuckles. 

&quot;Well there had to be a &#39;first rougarou,&#39; right? A progenitor?&quot; 

&quot;... I don&#39;t think it&#39;s a science-y egg-head scientist thing,&quot; Beau says. He chugs down his jug. &quot;I think... I think there&#39;s some spirit world stuff goin&#39; on, I mean. Lookit all the ghosts roun&#39; these parts. And the witch! You met her yet?&quot; 

&quot;... there&#39;s a witch here??&quot; you ask. You burp. 

&quot;Heh. Hawhaw. You be careful if you meet her,&quot; Beau nods. &quot;She got the voodoo, the hoodoo, everythin&#39;. Be polite to her, don&#39;t drink ANYTHING she tries to offer you, and don&#39;t mess with her little... totems and stuff. Little stick figures, scultures, wreaths, anything you see that ain&#39;t a natural thing out here on the island. What she call &#39;em again? //Fetishes.// Spooky //Blair Witch// shit. Don&#39;t touch &#39;em, just leave &#39;em be. She&#39;ll know.&quot; 

&quot;Do you think she, uhh... turned you? Into a rougarou?&quot; you ask after a big swig of moonshine. 

&quot;... shoot. She might&#39;ve.&quot; Beau scratches the back of his head. His ears twitch and he shakes his head for a second, just like a massive dog. &quot;I should ask her before. Or maybe I DID ask her once, and she voodoo&#39;d me so I forgot what she said... she&#39;s a special lady, she is,&quot; Beau says. &quot;I can&#39;t seem to eat her, OR catch her long enough to knock her up either.&quot; 

[[&quot;... knock her up?? Like...?&quot;-&gt;CWB IMP Q]] </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="176" name="CWB Impregnation" tags="RG end" position="772,540" size="100,100">... ssshhiiit, why are you all... 
it&#39;s gotta be the moonshine
it&#39;s some strong stuff you been chuggin&#39; down with good ol&#39; Beau. 
Great big... **buurrrp** beefy... beast. 

Beau cuddles your face into his chest for a moment, then lays you flat on your back on the bed. &quot;How&#39;d you like. To get. Knocked up.&quot; 

&quot;Mmm... knocked up?&quot; you coo. 

&quot;Mmm-hmm. Mmfff.&quot; Beau bites his lip for a second; it&#39;s scary &#39;cuz he got big fangs, but it&#39;s not scary &#39;cuz you&#39;re horny as hell. He pulls his shredded overalls off. A long, fat, drooling pecker bounces up at you. &quot;Knocked. The fuck. Up.&quot; 

&quot;Ooooo...&quot; you squirm a little on the bed. Hey, it&#39;s a comfy bed. Meant to hold his weight whether he&#39;s human or werewolf. &quot;You. You know. I&#39;m actually, a guy. Right? I mean. **burp** I don&#39;t think you can--&quot; 

&quot;Ohhh I sure can, ma cher,&quot; Beau rumbles. He looms over you now, his arms like big dark furry pillars on either side of your head. He leans in and his snout tickles your bare stomach as he sniffs you. &quot;//Le Rougarou,// he can IMPREGNATE. Whoever. He. Wants.&quot; 

&quot;Mmmm.&quot; You wriggle as he tugs your pants off, and your boxers, and his hands grip your ankles and lift your legs and spreads you... ohh fuck, he&#39;s just... cracking you open like a peanut, isn&#39;t he? 

You give him a coy little grin and you&#39;re not sure why you say it but you say it: &quot;Do you want to... impregnate... //me?//&quot; 

&quot;Grrrrr I DO,&quot; Beau growls. He mounts you. 

It must be the ridiculous moonshine helping your body out, because you don&#39;t feel like you need to resist, and you just sort of let him in. He slides in slowly, smoothly. You moan; you were already horny but now your great big beastly buddy is deep inside you and is claiming you as his mate, and you just, wow. You just feel so desirable. 

&quot;Gonna. FUCK. A baby. Right. In. Here.&quot; 

&quot;Right here?&quot; you moan. Your hands gesture at your abdomen. 

&quot;RIGHT there.&quot; 

&quot;In. My belly?&quot; 

&quot;A BIG baby. In. Yo&#39; belleh.&quot; Beau&#39;s speech is punctuated by huffing, snuffling growls and mighty thrusts. 

&quot;OoooOooOooOOOoOOOO,&quot; you start to moan like an inexperienced whore. &quot;Oooohhh **urp** BEAU is gonna make me PREGNANT...&quot; 

&quot;YES. **huff** HE. **huff** IS..... **belch**&quot; 

The combination of the absurdly strong moonshine you&#39;ve drunk, and Beau&#39;s masterful positioning, causes you to have the most explosive, messy orgasm you think you&#39;ve ever had. Unfortunately you don&#39;t get to see it painting Beau&#39;s abdominals white, because [[you black out with a huge smile on your face.-&gt;CWB Imp 2]] </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="177" name="CWB Imp 2" tags="RG end" position="768,666" size="100,100">You wake up. 

You&#39;re lying in the cabin still, in a nice warm... breathing... bed? 

No, you&#39;re lying on top of Beau. He&#39;s still a werewolf. His massive fur-coated pecs make good pillows, honestly. 

OH SHIT. You fucked a werewolf!! Or rather, the werewolf fucked YOU. Like. Royally. 

You roll off the bed and land on your hands and knees. Ugggh. You&#39;re sore, your head&#39;s spinning and throbbing... your ASS is throbbing too. And your stomach&#39;s like... fighting the entire Imperial Japanese Navy in there. 

Whoops! BANZAI!! You ralph all over the floor. 
Guess it&#39;s best to purge that abominable moonshine Beau filled you with. 

You catch your breath and sit back against the bed, hugging your knees to your body. You&#39;re naked, you&#39;ve puked your guts out (yet you still feel rather uncomfortably full), you&#39;re... possibly hungover? It doesn&#39;t feel like any hangover you&#39;ve ever experienced really. 

And your ass feels like it&#39;s been promoted. You wince and clench up. Shit. That&#39;s gonna take awhile to get back to normal... you shiver. 

&quot;Well good morning,&quot; Beau croons quietly behind you. He pats your head. &quot;Hey c&#39;mere smol fren.&quot; You don&#39;t resist as he pulls you back onto the bed and spoons you in his enormous arms. &quot;Feelin&#39; ok?&quot; 

&quot;Not really...&quot; 

&quot;Mmm, hey that&#39;s alright, lemme go get you some medicine, I know just what you need.&quot; He pats your stomach and then gets out of bed, leaving you laying there on your side. 

Then he glances back at you, and takes a sniff. &quot;... oh hey, that&#39;s a good smell!&quot; And you watch as he starts to shrink, and his fur fades away, and all his increased attributes, well... decrease. Soon he&#39;s just standing there bare-assed in his human form, grinning down at you. &quot;Now that you&#39;re carryin&#39; my pups in there, I can safely stay human for awhile.&quot; 

&quot;... pups??&quot; you ask, gazing down at your stomach. Shit, no wonder you feel kinda full, despite... that mess over there. No way! Is he serious? He must be! You kinda figured he was just joking-- or being euphemistic last night, with all that pregnancy talk. 

&quot;Well it might just be one, but, the more the merrier, ma cher,&quot; Beau grins. &quot;Means I&#39;ll have more control over the beast, for longer. Won&#39;t be so rarin&#39; to fuck all the time.&quot; He rummages around in a dresser and finds himself some clothes-- a pair of baggy basketball shorts, and a white t-shirt. &quot;I&#39;mma head into town and get you some medicine... you&#39;re welcome to come with, nah, but I&#39;d understand if you just wanna get some rest. I porked you GOOD last night, lil&#39; man.&quot; 

&quot;... am I actually pregnant?&quot; you whisper up at him. &quot;Like you&#39;re not just joking?&quot; 

&quot;Give it a few more hours,&quot; Beau shrugs. His shoulders and arms help fill that t-shirt out nice and snug; even in his much smaller human form, he&#39;s still pretty damn bulky. He&#39;s... 

fuck. You want so bad to be like... mad at him! Or offended, or indignant, but... but hot damn. Last night was just. 

Wow. 

&quot;I&#39;ll see you in a bit,&quot; Beau says. &quot;Rest up nah, y&#39;hear?&quot; 

[[And he leaves you alone in the cabin.-&gt;CWB Imp 3]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="178" name="CWB Imp 3" tags="RG end" position="901,614" size="100,100">Your movements are careful as you put your clothes back on and step out of the cabin. It&#39;s warm, a little humid, but not unbearable out. The sun&#39;s light plays with the lush earthy greenery of the surrounding tree canopy, and it&#39;s just beautiful. At night, the swamp&#39;s scary as fuck, but... during the day there&#39;s this lovely, primitive, just... just an //attitude// about the place. It&#39;s very unique. 

You spend the day exploring the island. It&#39;s not big-- perhaps the size of a community college campus, or otherwise, a few football fields overall. You discover a strange gloopy puddle with a sign that you can&#39;t read-- perhaps it says &#39;quicksand,&#39; or it used to? It&#39;s bubbly and noisy and looks gross. You also find some other interesting things: a burnt-looking thicket of dark, barren trees; a small graveyard with the caskets buried above ground in stone cases; a pagan-looking altar or shrine,  with little totems and fetishes made from pieces of nature... and what&#39;s unmistakably Beau&#39;s distillery where he makes his shine. You&#39;ll ask him about that later. 

As the day wears on though, you find yourself flushed in the heat. Your clothes feel all tight and you&#39;re just, sweaty and slick and ugh. So you cool off back at Beau&#39;s little shack; he&#39;s got a window unit to keep it cool in there, and it feels great. You relax on the bed, record some narration for your channel back home, and... 

Fuck, you gotta... ugh! You reach down and unbutton your jeans, and unzip them, and WOW does that feel nice. You hope you&#39;re not about to puke again, and that Beau&#39;s bringing food to... feed... your... 

Ohhh goodness. Goodness. Fucking. Gracious. Sakes. 

The door opens as you&#39;re staring down at yourself, and Beau steps in, but you ignore him. You&#39;re too busy tenderly touching your firmly bloated gut with careful hands. It&#39;s... it&#39;s like a food baby? Except it&#39;s a lot... ugh, //harder,// like... mmmfff... You&#39;re not tensed up or pushing your stomach out, and you feel EMPTY, hungry, like you don&#39;t feel bloated or full at all?? But... shit. 

Beau&#39;s hands slide over yours, and he pulls you into his big strong arms. &quot;Already showin&#39;, huh? Heheh. Heh.&quot; His rough, warm hands rub the tight skin of your small bump. &quot;I wonder how many are in here.&quot; 

&quot;I&#39;m actually pregnant,&quot; you whimper. 

&quot;Yep.&quot; Beau squeezes you close. And you don&#39;t hate it. You... fuck, you actually like it. What a //stud.// So indomitably masculine that he actually made another GUY pregnant! 

**END** 

You have a WEREWOLF growing in your belly! 

You can expect your weight and girth to utterly balloon in the next few weeks, as Beau informs you. He gives you medicine to calm your body down and help you adjust, and has brought a nice variety of moderately healthy snacks and food for you. 

You realize he&#39;s not eaten any himself, and then you take a good look at him and see that he, too, actually has a rather bloated belly. He explains that the Rougarou&#39;s next priority, now that you&#39;re pregnant, is going to be feeding. So in order to maintain control, he&#39;s gone and allowed Mammy Violette to fill him up with her weirdly dense ghost cooking. 

Which means you get to watch Beau&#39;s thick, muscular body plump up with a nice layer of soft padding all over, and by the time the sun sets he&#39;s probably gained 50 pounds or more. Good grief. Note to self? Don&#39;t. Eat. Ghost. Food. 

But he seems happy with it, calling it &#39;puttin&#39; mah daddy weight back on for a spell,&#39; and all it takes it one nice big hug for you to realize just how cuddly and soft he&#39;s gotten. 

You ask him, as you lay wrapped safely in his beefy arms, why did he decide to &quot;keep&quot; you. Instead of eating you. And he says at first, it was just pragmatism; you&#39;ve got close to a million subscribers on your channel, and if you suddenly vanished from the public eye it&#39;d raise eyebrows and draw unwanted attention. 

But then he realized that he didn&#39;t WANT to eat you... that he //liked// you, and he cuddles you close and you feel his thick softened body, and his big boner all over your back and his hands pat your growing belly proudly. 

Welp. You have a werewolf boyfriend now! And you&#39;re gonna be his babymama. Or... babydaddy? Do you both count as dads? 
Ehh. He&#39;s kind and cuddly and caring and protective... 
Worse things have definitely happened to you. 
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="179" name="KIT Vlog" tags="mammy" position="1814,689" size="100,100">You walk through the dusty dining room and into the kitchen. It&#39;s equally dusty and it looks like there&#39;s a bunch of plates and other cookware shattered all over the ground. You pull your phone out to start recording. It&#39;s a mess. There&#39;s just... smashed things. Everywhere. Plates, bowls, crockery, cups, saucers. Cutlery stuck in the walls and stains all over. 

&quot;Alright you guys, check this out...&quot; you narrate quietly. &quot;This is the kitchen obviously. Someone... had a fight in here or something, yeah? Look at all this-- SHIT.&quot; 

You hear a noise and immediately duck behind an open pantry door. You&#39;re not alone here, are you?! The realization arouses your fear as a reflex, but you squash it quickly: if you&#39;re not alone, then you&#39;ve got //views// as long as you can get some good footage. 

Your body prickles all over with chills as you hear the voice of a woman, floating through the room. She&#39;s... singing. You&#39;re not sure you&#39;ve ever heard the song: 

//&quot;If you get there before I do/ Coming for to carry me home/ Tell all of my friends, that I&#39;m coming there too/ Coming for to carry me ho--&quot; //

The singing stops. You peek out from behind the door. &quot;Now who the sam hill been up in MY kitchen, makin&#39; an ungodly mess like this?&quot; 

She&#39;s wide and robust, clad in a do-rag, black clothes and a white apron. She&#39;s also a ghost. Her foggy white-grey skin must have once been much darker.

You step out from your hiding place with your phone up. &quot;Hi!&quot; you say, in a quiet but pleasant voice. 

&quot;Ooo!&quot; the ghost lady startles. &quot;Was it you? You come up in here and mess up my kitchen like this??&quot; 

&quot;Uhh, no?&quot; you say. Holy shit you&#39;re talkin&#39; to a for-real GHOST! You try to keep it professional, but you&#39;re very excited. &quot;No, this was like this when I got here. What&#39;s your name?&quot; 

&quot;Oh, Violette,&quot; she says, &quot;but they all call me Mammy Vi roun&#39; here. What &#39;bout you?&quot; 

You tell her your name. &quot;I&#39;m kind of like an investigator,&quot; you say. &quot;I&#39;m here to, well... &#39;commune with the dead,&#39; if any are about,&quot; and you smile at her. 

&quot;Ohh. That&#39;s just silly witchcraft, they ain&#39;t no dead &#39;roun here,&quot; Mammy Vi says. 

Your eyes widen as you look into her round, sweet face. 

What do you say to that? 

[[&quot;Uhh... well, do you know where I might find some?&quot;-&gt;MammyExpDead]] 

[[&quot;But... what about you?

Ain&#39;t nice to bring witchery into a Christian family&#39;s final restin&#39; place.&quot; 

&quot;Oh don&#39;t worry, I&#39;m not actually looking to //summon// any of the dead,&quot; you say. &quot;Not like a seance or anything. Uh. I just roam places where the dead are supposed to congregate, and see if any of them will talk to me. No rituals or magic involved. No witchcraft necessary.&quot; 

How strange, that... she doesn&#39;t even seem to realize she&#39;s dead. 

Well, you don&#39;t wanna abandon her just yet. You center your camera on her. &quot;So if you don&#39;t mind me asking, what do you do around here?&quot; 

&quot;Ohh, a little o&#39; everythin&#39;, I s&#39;pose,&quot; Mammy Vi says with a little sigh. She wipes her hands off on her apron. &quot;Mostly cookin&#39; and cleanin&#39;. Ooo, speakin&#39; of cookin&#39;, that&#39;s my pie done,&quot; and she bustles over to the oven and sort of... fades? 

But then reappears RIGHT in front of you. You step back. 

&quot;Mmm, don&#39;t that smell wonderful?&quot; she says, and she&#39;s got... just, well, a straight-up ghostly-lookin&#39; pie. Same pale off-white transparent, just like her. Definitely a criss-cross pie. You&#39;ve got no idea what&#39;s in it. 

&quot;Yeah, I... it sure does,&quot; you say, kinda lamely. &quot;I wish I had time to stick around and--&quot; 

You almost scream, because for just a moment you don&#39;t see Mammy at all. Instead you see this... horrific, twisted neck, ghoulish skull wrapped in tatters. Like someone hollowed her out and skinned her and left her hanging up somewhere to dry. 

And then she&#39;s back, and she shoves the pie at you. &quot;Here, have a nice big piece.&quot; 

[[The entire. Pie. Is inserted. Into. Your abdomen.-&gt;MassiveFattening]] </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="182" name="MammyTrueShape" tags="mammy" position="1696,946" size="100,100">Mammy&#39;s head tilts sideways. 

A little too far. 

&quot;... what,&quot; she says, except her voice comes out as a rasp. 

&quot;You guys see this?&quot; you whisper at your phone, making sure to record every second of it. 

Suddenly the entire kitchen flickers, almost as if there&#39;d been a flash of lightning. And you see: 

She hangs high, with a bent neck, and empty eyes, and an appalling gaunt face with a slack jaw. 

**WHYHAVEYOUCOMEWHATDIDYOUDO** 

there are fires
there are people

**S W I N G S L O W** 

the creaking of a branch
swaying
swaying
back and forth

**THEYCOMETHEYCOMETHEYARECOMINGTHEYAREHERE** 

You flatten yourself against the wall, except for your quivering arm, outstretched, with your phone aimed at the horrifying sight. 

And there&#39;s Mammy Vi&#39;s kind, chubby face again. 

The kitchen flickers again and she&#39;s right in front of you, within hugging distance. &quot;Chile you lookin&#39; like you took sick all of a sudden. Come have a bite.&quot; She smiles pleasantly. 

In a flash, Mammy Vi shoves... SOMETHING into your half-open mouth. You taste a sweet, buttery biscuit or something similar. But there&#39;s nothing there! And you feel it land in your stomach, even though you didn&#39;t swallow... 

&quot;I have plenty,&quot; she says. &quot;I always make plenty of biscuits, since they&#39;re your favorite.&quot; Her eyes, for just a split second, turn hollow and black. And then she&#39;s back again. 

Oof. Ghost food&#39;s... kinda filling. You wince and glance down. It feels like that biscuit expanded or something. Feels like you ate a biscuit at least five times the size of the one you saw in her hand. 

&quot;Uhh, thanks, I&#39;ll just--GMPPH!!&quot; 

Mammy pops another phantasmal biscuit into your mouth. Once more you taste the flavor but feel no texture or presence of food, and then without swallowing you suddenly feel like something&#39;s landed in your stomach. You flinch hard and grunt and double over... and clutch at your abdomen. Fuck! You&#39;re fuckin&#39; FULL all of a sudden! Like... sheesh. 

Mammy floats here-- no, over there, she&#39;s by the wall-- no, she&#39;s RIGHT IN FRONT OF YOU-- no, she&#39;s by the oven. 

What are you gonna do? Apparently she can feed you her ghostly food and... uggghh. It&#39;s super dense. Can she chase you? If you leave the room, will she follow? ... if she can feed you her food, what happens if you throw something at her? Maybe if you flashed her with your phone&#39;s camera...?

Better do //something// before **SHE PREPARES TO FILL YOU** she pops back in front of you and sticks another one of those things in your mouth! 

[[Just fucking run! You can outrun a ghost, can&#39;t you?-&gt;CantOutrunMammy]]

You can see Mammy&#39;s ghostly shape flicking in and out of existence, in your peripheral vision. 

&quot;Don&#39;t go runnin&#39; chile,&quot; she scolds you. &quot;You&#39;ll get an upset stomach.&quot; 

And you make it to the door, only to slam flat against something HARD. Like a wall? Except there&#39;s nothing there. 

You take a step back, completely confused. You&#39;re looking straight at the dining room, and you came through this door earlier! But now it&#39;s solid. Even though you can see straight through it. 

You let out a strangled yell as you feel Mammy reach in through the BACK of your neck and deposit another ghostly pastry into your mouth. You can&#39;t chew it, you just... you feel its flavor all over, but no texture or matter... and then it all just trickles down. 

You belch and shudder as you feel this third item drop into your gut and weigh you down. Fuck, your jeans feel all tight now... How are you supposed to get out of here when you can&#39;t get out the door?? 

A loud voice bellows throughout the house. &quot;Aaayyy MAMMY! Sounds like you got a VISITOR!!&quot; 

Mammy stops her creepy flickering and teleporting, and appears normal. &quot;Is that you Beauregard?&quot; 

It... does sound like Beau, doesn&#39;t it? 

You nearly pass out when you look over to the far wall where Mammy first appeared, and see a great big dark werewolf face shove through the wall. Not in a way that damages it, either. Actually phasing through like a ghost. 

The werewolf steps into the kitchen, licking his lips as he eyes you. &quot;Tried to get out the usual way, huh? It don&#39;t work right when Mammy&#39;s cookin&#39; in her kitchen. Gotta use the door SHE used to use when she was alive...&quot; 

&quot;... Beau?&quot; you ask in a small voice. And let out a little burp. 

&quot;Heheh. Hawhawhaw. Hooohoho.&quot; Beau stalks closer, his massive werewolf body seeming to fill the kitchen. He just walks right through the far wall. &quot;How much o&#39; her cookin&#39; have you already eaten, smol fren? I bet you ain&#39;t gonna be smol much longer, haw haw haw; proper good-sized meal for me...&quot; 

Well THIS is just great. You&#39;ve got a huge werewolf there blocking a fucking ghost WALL which is apparently your only way out of here... and a teleporting ghost who wants to stuff you full of, oh crap, extremely filling **buuurrrp!** ghost food! 

&quot;Why don&#39;t you boys sit down, I&#39;ll fix you up a bite to eat?&quot; Mammy says cheerfully. She disappears for a second, and reappears with a big platter full of... something. On her shoulder. Looks like a metric fuckton of pastries. 

You think fast: 

[[&quot;Well I&#39;ve already had a little bit, why don&#39;t you offer Beau some? He looks hungry enough to eat ME!&quot;-&gt;MammyFeedBeau]] </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="184" name="ResetMammy" tags="mammy" position="1845,941" size="100,100">You aim your phone and take a picture of Mammy. The flash goes off. 

She sort of freezes. Fuck, she looks terrifying, all... dessicated and hung. She flickers back to normal, then back to the deathly apparition, and then... disappears. 

You sigh, and then start as you see her float in through the far wall again. &quot;Ohh there you are, chile, look I&#39;ve made some nice gumbo for our guests this evening, but I&#39;ll let you have a small taste if you like.&quot; 

Did you just... 
Did you actually just hard-reset a ghost? 

She looks as pleasant and homey as ever. She holds a ladle out to you. You can see a nearly invisible helping of stew in it. Ugh. Ok. You don&#39;t want to have her go batshit on you again, so you begrudgingly reach up and-- hey, you can kinda grab the ghost ladle? You don&#39;t feel it in your hands, nor in your mouth when you mime the action of sipping from it. The stew&#39;s nice and warm though. Spicy and savory. Goes well with the biscuits you had earlier. 

Shit. You are PACKED full now. You don&#39;t wanna just //leave,// as you&#39;ve still got a job to do here, but you definitely don&#39;t want any more mega-super-bloaty ghost food inside you! Maybe you can get her talking about... stuff. 

[[Ask her about ghosts-&gt;MammyExpDead]] now that she&#39;s calmed down. 

[[Ask her what song she was singing earlier.-&gt;MammyVisionsPast]] 

[[Just beat a hasty retreat.-&gt;KitSlipOut]] </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="185" name="MammyAttractBeau" tags="mammy RG" position="1850,807" size="100,100">You back away from her, and dodge to the side and nearly fall. As you stumble, you grab a piece of ceramic that was laying close by. Mammy&#39;s visage flicks between her sweet, chubby, wholesome-chef self, and her wicked-looking deathly pallor all dried and broken. And she appears close, and then far, to the left, and to the right, and you let FLY with the sharp shard in your hand. 

... well it passes right through her chest and shatters loudly against the floor on the other side. She turns normal-faced and giggles. &quot;Ohh chile. You gettin&#39; fresh? I&#39;mma smack you if you gettin&#39; fresh up in my kitchen nah.&quot; 

You then hear a distinctive pounding out in the hall. FUCK. Is that the monster from earlier?? You start looking for something to hide behind-- 

A massive force slams into your back and carries you halfway across the kitchen, holding you tight and FFFFFFFFUUUUCKKK THAT HURTS!!

You roll to your feet and face the new threat. 

&quot;Heheheh,&quot; Beau&#39;s voice emanates from the dripping jaws of the ten-foot-tall beast getting to its feet. &quot;Nobody knows at first. But when Mammy cookin&#39; in her kitchen, the doors //switch.//&quot; 

... did he just come through the wall? The wall where... Mammy came through earlier... ? 

Shit, he&#39;s like... it&#39;s Beau? But he&#39;s a big fucking werewolf thing?? 

&quot;Beau you wanna explain to me why you&#39;re a WEREWOLF?&quot; You ask, clutching your shoulder. You peek down and hold your hand up. Fuck, you&#39;re bleeding. You might&#39;ve landed on another piece of something broken. 

... or that... those might be, uhh... tooth marks. 

Beau&#39;s shiny werewolf eyes frown down at you. &quot;Well... I, hmm. Wait a second.&quot; 

&quot;Did you fucking BITE ME you asshole?&quot; you snap. 

&quot;Hey nah, you boys watch your language!&quot; Mammy chides in the background. &quot;I&#39;mma not have all this cursin&#39; an&#39; hollerin&#39; up in my kitchen! This&#39;s holy ground here, go on outside if you gonna do that!&quot; 

Beau&#39;s eyes get big and he looks down at his hulking, furry, powerful werewolf body. As it. starts. to. shrink. 

[[&quot;... uh-oh.&quot;-&gt;BeauShrinkYouGrow]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="186" name="MammyFeedBeau" tags="mammy RG" position="1839,1076" size="100,100">&quot;Ohh that&#39;s such a sweet boy,&quot; Mammy smiles real big at you and with a flick of her wrist, there&#39;s a football-sized pastry floating through the air. It hits the werewolf right in the face. 

Beau&#39;s cheeks puff out for a second, and he shakes his head and his nostrils flare. &quot;Nah hold up just a minute Mammy, I&#39;m tryin&#39; to save room for uhh... the //main course,// haw haw...&quot; and he glares over at you. &quot;You wouldn&#39;t wanna mess up my appetite for dinner, nah, wouldya?&quot; 

&quot;Ohh I suppose not then,&quot; Mammy Vi says. She giggles as Beau&#39;s thick midriff emits a few gurgles and suddenly bloats outwards a bit with her, um, ghostly input. 

And then before you know it, one of those tasty phantom eclairs has sailed across the room right at your face. You duck under it at the last second, but it orbits you and circles down around your body, and before you can react further, it phases //straight// into your abdomen, right through your navel. **burp!** A split second later your belly feels heavy and overstuffed, and you plump up slightly just like Beau with a soft little curve pressed against your t-shirt. 

&quot;Yes, that&#39;s right,&quot; Beau chuckles at you. He takes a menacing step closer as you grunt and try to force up another burp by pounding on your chest a few times. &quot;Have some more of Mammy Vi&#39;s proper Southern hospitality. Best food south of the Mason-Dixon line, I guaran-TEE.&quot; 

&quot;I&#39;m so glad you enjoy my cookin&#39; Beauregard,&quot; Mammy trills, catapulting a biscuit his way. Like a well-trained dog, his jaws clap shut around it-- a reflex reaction, judging by the way he pounds the counter immediately after and swear quietly at his own instincts betraying him. You snicker as his furry belly balloons outward. He&#39;s like... a dadbod werewolf now. 

&quot;Well uhh... I mean make sure you save plenty for our guest, yeah?&quot; Beau says. He bares his teeth at you. It&#39;d be scary if you hadn&#39;t just watched him swell up like a cartoon. It&#39;s much scarier when he lumbers a few steps closer to you-- of course, you back away, but the counter island&#39;s right behind you and you sort of lean back over it slightly when it presses against your lower back. 

Mammy takes this opportunity to launch a muffin straight into your gut, which means you&#39;re on full display as you wince and feel yourself puffing up like a loaf of bread baking. &quot;Uhh... **urp** well gee, thanks Mammy Vi, I&#39;m pretty full now, but...&quot; 

Beau&#39;s almost within arm&#39;s reach of you. Time to go nuclear. &quot;Listen, he wants to eat me, ok? So when you feed //me,// you&#39;re basically fattening me up for him. But if you feed //him,// then he won&#39;t have room for ME.&quot; 

&quot;Ohh shoo, chile, why didn&#39;t you say so earlier?&quot; Mammy claps her hands and gives her apron a little shake. 

&quot;Nonono, nah that ain&#39;t true, Uhh... I was just--&quot; 

&quot;You hush up nah Mr. Beauregard,&quot; Mammy says, and suddenly there&#39;s this great big pot of stew or something hovering beside her. She scoops a bunch out with a ladle and pops it into his mouth before he can finish talking. 

&quot;Nah see here!&quot; Beau snaps. He lunges at you hungrily. 

And Mammy just sort of holds her pot in front of his body. 

The big pot of stew disappears, and Beau&#39;s eyes bulge out. He sinks to his knees, and falls backwards. A mighty **BELCH** makes the entire mansion quiver. 

And then you and Mammy watch, and giggle, as Beau&#39;s belly starts pumping up like someone&#39;s stuck a hose in his mouth. He huffs and pants and his feet twitch and his clawed fingers open and shut, but there&#39;s nothing he can do. His body is swelling and bloating and inflating with ghostly gumbo. 

You hold your own rounded gut as you bellylaugh at him. &quot;Hey. Hey that&#39;s what you get, man.&quot; 

Beau can&#39;t even talk; he just pants and glares up at you from his position on the floor, but then winces as his gut continues to balloon into a vast furry dome. It rises high above his pecs, like a lost island breaching the surface of the sea. 

Your own stomach gurgles some, and you decide it&#39;s time to go. Mammy reaches over and pats Beau&#39;s bulging abdomen-- which is big enough for you, or her, to curl up inside comfortably-- and waggles a finger at him. &quot;You don&#39;t be eatin&#39; our guests now. That&#39;s a bad boy.&quot; 

Beau burps. 

[[You back out of the kitchen and wander off.-&gt;PlodUpstairs RGST]] </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="187" name="MassiveFattening" tags="mammy RG badend" position="2320,1210" size="100,100">You blanch, staring down at her hands, which are like... shoved directly into your stomach. Ugh, you... you can feel a //mass// sitting in there like... ew! But it feels like there&#39;s nothing? It&#39;s hard to describe. Ghosts don&#39;t seem to be on the same plane of existence as humans, and therefore can&#39;t interact with you properly-- in a way your brain and senses can process correctly. 

And then Mammy Vi just disappears. 

You see a flicker of her white ghostly self, hovering across the kitchen, and it&#39;s almost like she&#39;s forgotten about you. Then she phases through the wall, over on the opposite side of the big bay window. 

You shake your head and look around the kitchen. You&#39;re alone now, so... might as well get a little bit more for the video. You lean your phone against a pot, make sure it&#39;s recording and you&#39;re in the shot, and take a few steps away. 

&quot;Ok guys. That? That was a ghost. She was like a... chef lady... I mean I don&#39;t wanna call her a //slave,// but that might have been the ghost of a slave, just sayin&#39;,&quot; you say, with a little nervous laugh. &quot;I didn&#39;t catch it on camera but... well maybe I did? Everything&#39;s happening so fast, I don&#39;t know. Did you see? She like... fed me a pie? Except I don&#39;t... feel it...&quot; 

your voice trails off, because you start to feel... a very, very powerful pressure starting to build up in your stomach. Like you&#39;re about to let a massive fart rip. Or a huge belch. &quot;Heh. Shit. Ok yeah. Ghost food isn&#39;t meant for humans, ok?&quot; you chuckle. 

You freeze up and listen. 

Was that a door opening? 

[[Go check it out.-&gt;HoldFat RG Gain End]]

FFFfuck. You really, REALLY gotta burp something fierce, but... you gotta hold that shit in until you&#39;re sure you&#39;re safe. You creep closer to the door on the opposite side; you can see the front door through it, hanging open slightly. 
Someone came in after you. Or someTHING. 

You flatten yourself against the wall, and prepare to slowly... peek... around... the corner-- 

HOLY SHIT you scramble backwards as a sharp-toothed werewolf snout pokes around the corner to greet you. Hellish, shining eyes rake across you; you back away, stumbling over a chair, and watch the beast stalk four-legged into the room with you. 

It stands up to its full height. You feel absolutely microscopic. It&#39;s got to be ten feet tall. It feels like it&#39;s filled the entire room with its bulk. Like a big bear. Except you can clearly see wolf-like features. 

A long, muscular arm takes a swipe at you, and you jump back. You&#39;ve got no idea what to do, or how to fight this creature. 

So you turn tail and [[GTFO as fast as you can,-&gt;HoldFat Vo End]] heading for the kitchen. Which is a dead end, but there&#39;s no werewolf in it yet, as far as you&#39;re aware. 
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="189" name="WaitKit BalloonFuck" tags="RG badend" position="2472,1171" size="100,100">Well, caution is important. You look around and see if there&#39;s any place in here you can hide. There&#39;s a pantry... in fact, it&#39;s only a few feet from the door. You move close to it. How convenient! You can listen for anything heading this way, and then slip right into this cupboard... with thin wooden doors that won&#39;t protect you at all but if whatever&#39;s out there doesn&#39;t know you&#39;re here, right?? 

Oooo. Your abdomen gurgles loudly and feels like it&#39;s turning over. Mmff. Very, very full. You need to let some major burps out soon. Maybe you can hold them in and keep them quiet as they come out, like... like a pressure release valve-- **urp** ooo shit. There was a tiny one... You clap your hand to your mouth as another little **brraap** pumps up and out. 

Ohh crap. There&#39;s... there&#39;s footsteps outside. Nono: INSIDE. Out in the hall, or the living room, you can&#39;t tell exactly where. But they&#39;re loud and very heavy. 

**burp!** you COVER your mouth quick. Fuckin&#39; hell, you can&#39;t be doin&#39; that! You&#39;ll attract its attention, whatever it is! To be safe, you pull open one of the pantry doors and slip inside. **urp** //Fuckin&#39; stop!!//

Ohh the burps feel good though. You gotta get them out. You pull the pantry door closed and... **burp!... buuurrp... urp** let a few fly. Man that feels better. Ghost food is GASSY food. Got your clothes feeling all tight and uncomfortable. Yuck. 

You reach down and sort of absently rub your bloated stomach. 

It doesn&#39;t feel... as firm, or flat, as it should. Definitely puffed up with all that gas from Mammy&#39;s... pie or whatever. //Oooff.// You wince and... **BBBUUUUURRRPPP** ohh fuck that was loud. 

Wait. Wait wait... you whimper as you feel something that isn&#39;t quite gas rolling through your gut, and balling its way down your legs and up your arms. Up your throat. You hold your hands up. 

Your arms! Your arms are like... thickening up?? Your fingers look all swollen, what the fuck?? &quot;What&#39;s... happening to me...?!&quot; you gasp out as you feel your entire body, like... 

//Growing.// 

&quot;Ohh. Ohhh. OhhhoOhhhnooo!!&quot; you whine, and you&#39;re trying to stay quiet but you&#39;ve never legit had to feel yourself packing on two-pounds-per-second. You look down and see your gut positively //billowing// outwards; you&#39;re getting wider and fuller and thicker and so //heavy// it&#39;s like you&#39;re just... made of doug, and someone&#39;s baking the HELL outta you. You reach up and feel your face; your jawline softens and your neck thickens and you have a double, ohh fuck no a TRIPLE chin now and your cheeks are just... **BUUUUURRP** 

As you continue to fatten, you&#39;ve forgotten to listen, and suddenly the loud footsteps are right outside the pantry. 

The door is flung open by a gigantic, furry, claw-fingered hand. You throw your hands up by reflex as you see what you can only describe as a monster-movie werewolf, some ten feet tall, all dark fur and gleaming eyes and big sharp teeth. 

It opens its mouth and you know you&#39;re about to die. 

[[&quot;Well nah, lookee what I got here,&quot;-&gt;WeightFuck End]] the huge beast growls and chuckles down at you. </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="190" name="KitSlipOut" tags="mammy RG" position="2051,824" size="100,100">&quot;Well thanks, uhh, Mammy Vi.

&quot;Well you go on then sweet chile,&quot; Mammy says. 

You back out of the kitchen, smiling pleasantly at her. She turns away to stir an invisible pot, and you see her disappear. 

Back in the Dining Room, you get one last shot of the kitchen with its messy floor and dusty air... 

And when you turn back around you gasp and freeze stiff. 

Standing there at the other end of the Dining Room is a massive dark shape, with pointed ears and eyes that seem to glow in the dark. You see lips part and a long tongue moisten a set of finger-sized fangs. 

It growls, and [[CHARGES YOU!-&gt;RunRG SlipAlt]] </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="191" name="RunRG SlipAlt" tags="" position="2060,964" size="100,100">You tear off in to the kitchen and swing around the door, but the beast is hot on your heels; you know there&#39;s nowhere to run but there&#39;s like some knives and stuff in here and if you can just-- 

OOWWWWW THE FUCKK MAAN!! You yell //something// as the monster lunges and knocks you flying, but it slips on the dust and debris in the process and you both skid across the floor. Your shoulder hurts and you&#39;re kinda dazed, but you roll to your feet to face the monster as it, too, rounds on you. It&#39;s a far more menacing presence this close, and in a more enclosed space. 

The huge dark fuzzy shape seems to fill the entire kitchen. &quot;Well nah,&quot; it says, in Beau&#39;s fucking voice. &quot;This where you been hidin&#39; all this time?&quot; 

&quot;Beau?&quot; you ask. Your hand clutches your shoulder. You must&#39;ve landed on it, or got cut on a sharp piece of broken whatever. Because you pull your hand away and see blood. &quot;What the fuck, man? You&#39;re a werewolf? What, did you get me here so you could eat me or something? I&#39;mma fight you all the way down, I hope you know that!&quot; Shit, you sound a lot braver than you feel. And your shoulder fuckin&#39; STINGS man. As if you weren&#39;t already at a disadvantage. 

&quot;Nah you know what you boys come up in here makin&#39; a mess in my kitchen and I&#39;mma tan your hides!&quot; Mammy Violette snaps at the pair of you. She waggles a wooden spoon. &quot;Just &#39;cuz I&#39;m gettin&#39; older don&#39;t mean I can&#39;t still spank you like the dickens! Nah get on outta here with that fightin&#39; mess and them harsh words!&quot; 

You both ignore her and she seems to ignore you as well, returning to her &#39;cooking.&#39; 

Beau&#39;s snout flares as he sniffs the air, then narrows his shiny werewolf eyes at you. &quot;... did I... //shit,// did I BITE you??&quot; 

&quot;... you better not have motherfuckin&#39;...&quot; You gasp as your shoulder twinges hard, sending a sharp tingle all throughout your body. You stare at it. 

Those are... fang holes. Tooth marks. That&#39;s... oh shit. 

Beau shivers, every last bulging muscle twitching under his dark fur. 
[[&quot;BULLshit,&quot; he mutters.-&gt;BeauShrinkYouGrow]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="192" name="BeauShrinkYouGrow" tags="mammy RG badend" position="2061,1113" size="100,100">You wince. Your shoulder throbs and burns. 

Beau shudders, violently, and you see him //shrink// in a rapid little spurt. From his full size of roughly ten-feet-high, down to... maybe eight? And he twitches, and shivers, he flexes his hands and watches them lose their claws and size. He watches his arms slim down, he doubles over and grunts as his torso compresses. The fur fades away from his skin. 

Vicious pain grips you like a hand made of knives grabbing your shoulder. You scream, but it turns into a rasping whimper... and then it&#39;s gone? 

You look away from Beau&#39;s transformation and realize that your shoulder&#39;s all... pink now. Like. Scarred over, under the ripped shirt. There&#39;s still blood but it&#39;s no longer flowing freely. And then it starts to pulse. Hard. You feel your heart starting to race. Your head pounds with each beat. 

&quot;Uh-uh, nah-uh, I ain&#39;t havin&#39; this //rougarou// business up in here, you get yo&#39; furry butts outside &#39;fore I beat &#39;em!&quot; Mammy says. You don&#39;t even see her, it&#39;s like she&#39;s speaking over an intercom. 

Panting and heaving, you lean on the kitchen island, and watch as your veins start to stick out of your hand and arm. They fade back in smoothly but then your entire ARM fattens up with fresh bulk... and your face tingles, and when you feel your cheeks and jawline you feel stubble growing in rapidly... 

Nearby you see Beau fall over, tripping in his overalls which are now all stretched out by his previous beastly girth and won&#39;t stay up anymore. He&#39;s completely human again. And nude. 

Your head twitches. You clutch at your temples and feel your ears going pointy. Ahh FUCK your hands feel HUGE.... 

**YOU ARE TURNING INTO A WEREWOLF** 

How do you feel about that? 

[[Fuck no! This is terrible and you hate it! Gotta... fight... it!!-&gt;RG TF Resist VO]] 

[[Wait this is actually kinda... fascinating?? Watch in awe.-&gt;RG TF Enjoy IMP]] 

[[Grrr it fucking hurts and you&#39;re gonna KILL BEAU FOR THIS!!-&gt;RG TF Angry Stuff]] </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="193" name="RG TF Resist VO" tags="RG badend" position="1926,1295" size="100,100">&quot;Uuugnngngghhhh... nnnooo... NOOO!!&quot; you gasp out as you see your hands doubling in size and length. Your arms pump up with great big muscles. Your entire body swells up, then seems to shrink back down, and then SWELLS again... and it fucking BURNS. It burns so bad, everytime you feel yourself start to grow... you don&#39;t know how to fight it, but you reason that it&#39;s just mind over matter, and you growl and thrash backwards, panting hard, eyes squinted shut. 

//I&#39;m human I&#39;m human I&#39;m human I&#39;m human// 

//THIS ISn&#39;T hAPpENING STOP it stop stop stop this is not hPAPPAPENINNINGNIGGNNG...// 

&quot;AHH!!&quot; you fall down as you feel your legs BREAK. No, not really, but fffUCK they hurt. You hunch and writhe on all fours, before your arms sear with more pain and give out underneath you. Your back aches and arches up and &quot;NNNOO STOP STOOOPP!!&quot; you pound the ground and scream as you feel your torso bulge with huge muscles and heavy weight. 

Somewhere nearby you see Beau scrambling away from you and trying to put his pants back on. You glare at him but your eyes, AHHH IT&#39;S LIKE YOUR EYES ARE BEING STABBED you blink and cover your face and feel it distorting and stretching outwards... 

You just. //WANt it TO SoTPtopSTOPSTOPSTOPSTOP MAKE IT STOP!!!// 

you sob. you can&#39;t... fight... anymore it hurts ohh fucking cunting shitting sonnuvaBITCH IT HURTS SO MUCH

You feel your t-shirt stretch to the max around your chest and peel up off your stomach as you thicken and bulk. You try to get to your feet. No, you can still stop this, you just have to remember that you&#39;re human and you&#39;re AAHHAHAHHHHH FUCK FUCK FUCK STOP MAKE IT STOP

You hear a ripping noise all around you; you see your skin darken and fluff over with soft thick fur and your ears are and your eyes and your hands are and you look down and your pants are and you are and and and

very

very

//hungry// 

You take a deep breath. 
Big breath. Big sniff. There&#39;s Beau. 
His fault. 

He runs for the wall. Fake door, ghost door. He smacks into it. No Mammy Vi. No ghost door. 

You feel your body vibrate with a great big powerful growl. 
Beau&#39;s not that big. Really. Didn&#39;t he used to be bigger and stronger than you? He&#39;s not now. 

Very hungry. 

&quot;Hey look ma cher you ain&#39;t gotta do this, there&#39;s other ways to-- NO NO PLEASE DON&#39;T!!&quot; You reach out and grab. He&#39;s small. He&#39;s light. He will fit. 

You pop him headfirst into your mouth, and slurp him down easy. Like a wriggly noodle. You smile. Mmm. Not hungry now. Happy. All good. No more pain. Heheheh. Heheh. You sit. Big belly now. Very full. Round. Heheh. Fuzzy. When did you get so big and fuzzy? You&#39;re nice. It&#39;s nice to be so large. And soft. And POWERFUL. Heheh. 

Good time to nap. You flop back and close your eyes, dreamy. Big round tummy in front of you. Bumpin&#39; around with a fresh meal. Mmm. 

Food time, sleep time, later it&#39;ll be FUCK time! Sleep time now though! 

**END** 

You have transformed into a //rougarou!!// Resisting the change didn&#39;t really help in the end, it just made you extra hungry, and the first available meal was... well. Beau. So you gobbled him up. He&#39;s a nice beefy sorta guy, he&#39;ll be quite nutritious. 

You wake up and sit up lazily some time later. Your big body is gurgling and feeling ready to stalk and hunt and find a mate to FUCK. You&#39;re very horny. And your full belly has shrunk quite a bit. You grunt, and sigh in content, and feel it digest the rest of the way, shrinking back down to a nice flat rock solid core. 

&quot;Hey nah... this ain&#39;t right! What the fuck man! This some BULLSHIT right here!&quot; Beau says. You look around. Oh hey. He&#39;s all pale and glowy and see-through like Mammy Vi. Heheh. You chuckle at him. Serves him right; he was trying to do the same thing to you! 

You get up, but you&#39;re still not quite used to your larger new body so you stumble a bit-- and then you realize that you&#39;re //getting even bigger// as you process Beau&#39;s nutritious self. You can&#39;t help but laugh. Hey, it feels good! Why&#39;d you even bother to try and fight it earlier?? It&#39;s nice feeling your muscles pump up bigger and beefier like this! It makes your dick ROCK HARD too. As soon as you find a proper mate, all you&#39;re gonna have to do is flex a bit and she&#39;ll be flat on her back ready for your

PUPS</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="194" name="RG TF Enjoy IMP" tags="RG mammy end" position="2044,1296" size="100,100">... wow, this is... this is actually kinda cool?? 

You gaze at your hands, your arms, and flex and grin as you start growing and GROWING, getting bigger, and BIGGer, and **BIGGER** holy FUCKING SHIT this is awesome!! You&#39;re turning into a great big SEXY BEAST; just... just a huge, HUGE beast. 

HUGE. 

You feel your t-shirt tighten up, and strrreeeetttchhh RIP SNAP it breaks around your bulging beefy arms and you laugh as you watch bushy chest hair FLUFF out of you and spread down your belly, and laugh, and laugh, and HOT DAMN you&#39;re horny as fuck watching yourself changing into a monster. 

You kinda of stagger around as your legs grow thick and powerful to support all this extra weight you&#39;re gaining. Your head shakes; you twitch as your face distorts and stretches out into a proper werewolf snout. Your eyes tingle and you blink a few times and suddenly the darkness is NOT an issue, you can see just fine. 

Your phone clatters away as your hulking thighs bust your jeans off. You bend down and try to pick it up with your massive hands, and see claws push out of your fingers. Mmff. MMMFFF you&#39;re getting so BIG. Massive and muscular and MANLY and **MONSTROUS** 

Oohhh look. There&#39;s Beau. Look how small. So tiny. Didn&#39;t he used to be bigger than you? Not anymore, hehehehehehe.... 

&quot;Nah wait, wait a minute nah,&quot; he stammers as you reach for him. He ducks aside and then slides out of your reach. &quot;Hold on there fren! Uhh listen, listen this ain&#39;t gotta be this way, we can work somethin&#39; out nah...&quot; 

He he hehehe... You show him all your teeth as you smile. &quot;**BEAU,**&quot; you manage to speak, and hot DAMN your voice is just... disgustingly deep and masculine and dominant. Absolutely amazing. Is being a werewolf supposed to be a curse or something? What fucking idiot called it a curse in the first place? 

Beau sprints and... disappears into the wall? The fuck? You reach for it. Your hand passes right through. The FUCK?! You step through and look around. You&#39;re back in the hallway, and... oh there&#39;s BEAU. 

COME BACK HERE BEAU

You run run run run run run run huff huff huff huff huff pant pant pant you&#39;re so fast

You GRAB HIM and his tiny self. Look how SMALL. Your hands scoop him up nicely. You jerk him back into the house and carry him over to the living room and flatten him on his back, over a large ottoman or lounge chair or something... it&#39;ll do. 

&quot;Nononono just wait a sec my fren,&quot; Beau whimpers up at you. Shoot. He looks terrified. 

&quot;Now. You know. How it feels. To be hunted. Right?&quot; You rumble down at him. Mmm. You&#39;ve never done this before? Never pinned a man on his back and... grabbed his legs and cracked him wide open... 

&quot;Please please no!!&quot; Beau sobs. He twists and tries to wriggle free, but he&#39;s yours now. And you&#39;re going to make it official. 

You... wow. You didn&#39;t even realize before, but. You&#39;ve got a MASSIVE FUCKING DICK NOW. 

Beau wails as you stuff him full of yourself and begin to make him pregnant. Soon his belly is large and round and sloshing with your virile, beastly cum. 

**END** 

You have become a //rougarou!!// A great big powerful HORNY rougarou. A werewolf really, but that&#39;s just what they call it down South. 
And boy do you go down SOUTH with Beau. You&#39;ve got a fancy new oversized dick with a set of industrial-strength-output balls attached, and you empty a massive load into his bowels. You don&#39;t stop until he&#39;s laying there twitchy and blacking out and swollen, with a belly that looks 6 months along already. And you cradle him close and claim him as your special little mate. 

... of course, the next day, having freshly seeded a mate, the rougarou decides it&#39;s time to go dormant, so you are able to change back into your human form. Beau is very placatory towards you and waddles around with his sloshy gut, bringing you clothes to replace the ones you lost, explaining some things about being a werewolf, and agreeing to take you back to your car without... telling the world about things. 

That&#39;s fine. You&#39;re not sure you wanna tell the world either. And now that you know how to handle things, you figure you can keep the beast under control. It&#39;s simple: feed, fuck, and forget. If the monster gets hungry, feed it. If it gets horny, find a hole to breed. Shoot, Beau&#39;s already starting to show by the time he gets you back to your car. Despite being, of course, completely, anatomically, 100% male. Heheh. You&#39;re just that good, eh? Remember: he was probably gonna do the same to you. So don&#39;t feel too bad for him. 

And there&#39;s a few big cities around here, plenty of VICTIMS to choose from... and if you get tired of that scene, there&#39;s remote, isolated places like Bayou Lourde //all over,// which you can drive to, or if it suits your fancy, transform and let the beast run wild and free. Louisiana seems like the perfect place to be a werewolf, doesn&#39;t it? </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="195" name="RG TF Angry Stuff" tags="RG badend" position="2174,1311" size="100,100">You slam your fist on the table, shivering as you watch it grow, doubling in size. The growth travels up your arm, pumping you bigger, throbbing, pulsing all the way up to your shoulder with great big beefy muscle. Your bones creak all the way through as they, too, thicken and strengthen to carry your increasing weight. 

You don&#39;t know how to fight this off, and you can&#39;t help the way the changes throw your body around and make you thrash and writhe like you&#39;re being tortured... but you are ABSOLUTELY PISSED THE FUCK OFF and as you feel fur popping out of every pore of your skin, you hunch, and jerk, and &quot;RRAARRGGHGH&quot; feel your spine snap out and wave behind you, it&#39;s a TAIL, you&#39;ve grown a tail, 

MOTHERFUCKING BEAU GAVE YOU A MOTHERFUCKING TAIL

You make an attempt at lunging for him. He scrabbles backwards, still nude, looking terrified. &quot;Hey nah hold up ma fren, it ain&#39;t gotta be like this!!&quot; 

Your claws dig sharp ruts in the tile as you lash out. You&#39;re stopped only by your muscles jerking you around as they bulk up. You watch the sleeves of your t-shirt stretch tight and then break open around your bulging shoulders. You can&#39;t... you can move, you CAN move, but you can&#39;t... quite... it&#39;s... you&#39;re getting SO BIG NOW and you&#39;ve got to figure out what to do with yourself, where to put this arm and this leg and where to step and are you bipedal still and what&#39;s that tail even doing there

Your eyes lock on Beau, who&#39;s backed into the corner. You snarl. You wanna FUCKING TEAR HIM TO SHREDS and you stand up tall and stomp over and your hand cranks back to claw his guts out... 

Something soft impacts your stomach. You frown and look down. The ghost of Mammy Vi is standing there with her hand inside your abdominal region. &quot;Now see here chile, I ain&#39;t havin&#39; nobody makin&#39; any more messes up in my kitchen. You gonna sit on down a spell, and leave Mr. Beauregard alone. You want somethin&#39; to eat? I&#39;mma get you somethin&#39; to eat.&quot; 

You wriggle as she pulls her hand out of your gut and your eyes widen as you feel, and watch, yourself BLOOOOAAT rather smoothly. You growl a little. This is food but it ain&#39;t... the food you WANT TO EAT... You sneer at Beau, who&#39;s getting to his feet and sliding along the wall. 

He bolts. You mark where he&#39;s going and lash out, but... but he disappears?? and Mammy is //right there,// holding a big ghostly pie in her hands, and she pops the entire thing right into your mouth. 

Mmmm. Cherries. 

Nono wait-- **bbblllloooooaattt** you grunt and roll back on your haunches and watch your furry belly swell up, firm and round like you&#39;re growing a pumpkin inside. Mmfff. You feel kinda horny now. Food and fuck, that&#39;s the best things. Two more important things. Eat, and mate. Well here&#39;s the food... 

Nonono. BEAU. You gotta... You stand up. Mammy&#39;s disappeared. How did BEAU disappear, when he&#39;s a human now? He&#39;s not a ghost. Not YET AT LEAST... You sniff the wall where you saw him disappear. 

&quot;Hey nah, what&#39;d I say?&quot; Mammy Vi says somewhere down below. You glare down at her. She&#39;s distracting you from your PREY. Maybe SHE wants to be prey?? 

Well fine then. You snarl and bite downwards towards her. 

Ooo, //tasty// deep-fried chicken. Where&#39;d that come from? 

Ohh FUCK-- BLOAT. BLOAT. BLOAT. You stagger backwards as you watch your stomach swell and inflate in great big spurts, getting bigger and heavier in front of you, fffffffuck it&#39;s hanging there... You let out a big juicy werewolf BELCH and flop back on your ass, against the kitchen island. 

&quot;There nah. You just sit tight,&quot; Mammy Vi says. 

She&#39;s got... a big ghostly pot in her hands.

As you walk past the stairs, you see a light flicker at the top-- a candle. 

Held by a figure. 

You tense, wincing at your hindered status. Now&#39;s not a good time to be packed full like a fratboy at a pizza party. 

&quot;Eyy mon, what&#39;s goin&#39; on down there?&quot; a female voice with a thick Jamaican accent says. 

&quot;Uhh... I&#39;ve been formally introduced to Mammy Vi,&quot; you say. 

&quot;Oohhh. Gotcha, gotcha,&quot; she says. &quot;Well, c&#39;mon up, I&#39;ve got just the ting.&quot; 

Slightly nervous, but not having any better ideas, you [[plod upstairs.-&gt;Alt Witch Intro]] </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="197" name="VWitch Intro" tags="VW" position="1259,1583" size="100,100">You walk down the hall to the door with the light flickering underneath. It&#39;s orangey, like... a candle. A rather bright candle. 

Should you knock? Might as well. You reach up to knock. 

Before your knuckles even come close to the wood, the door swings gently open wide. 

There&#39;s... a woman there. A REAL woman, not a ghost. She raises an eyebrow at you. &quot;Hmm. Not quite who I expected, mon, but I s&#39;pose I don&#39; give a fuck. C&#39;mon in, we&#39;ll have us a chat since you&#39;re here.&quot; 

You stare at her blankly. Definitely caught you off-guard. 

She turns and jerks her head for you to follow her. 

[[So you do.-&gt;The Study VW Intro]] </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="198" name="MammyVisionsPast" tags="mammy" position="1339,1267" size="100,100">&quot;... ohh, just... just a song we sing, chile,&quot; Mammy says, sounding wistful, mournful. &quot;A song about the Lord.&quot; 

She disappears, and reappears at the table by the window, dabbing at her eyes with her apron. 

She disappears, and reappears, and you see her bent over pulling something out of the oven. 

&quot;Just a song.&quot; 

She disappears, and reappears, and you watch her sliding across the kitchen floor, slowly, away from you. Slowly. Her arms are up at weird angles like someone&#39;s on either side of her, dragging her away. She passes through the far wall. 

&quot;Ohh, just a song we sing, chile,&quot; her voice echoes. &quot;Someday the Lord gonna carry us all home.&quot; 

Shit. Shit this got heavy all of a sudden. You feel an immense sorrow grip your heart, and it&#39;s not even your own. You back away. 

When you turn to face the dining room, you have a vision, lasting only a few seconds, of a splendid banquet laid out for a group of vaguely humanoid pale shapes. Two darker shapes stand beside the archway as you pass through. You can make out no faces or features. 

The food looks delicious. 

Soon it&#39;s all gone, except for a massive, vaguely rounded shape at the head of the table across the room from you. 

&quot;Very good, very good,&quot; says a voice you haven&#39;t heard yet-- portly, somewhat mush-mouthed, an older male. &quot;Bring more, Violette.&quot; 

&quot;Yessah,&quot; you hear Mammy say. She&#39;s nowhere to be found. 

You take a deep breath. 

You got ALL that shit on recording. 

Exhilirated, you turn your phone off, and head out into the hallway. 

&quot;Damn.&quot; You lean against the wall for a second and give yourself a moment to process. Well, now&#39;s as good a time as any to head upstairs and see what else you can record. You bring your phone back up and record, as you make one last little ambient lap around the living room, the parlor, and the hall... and notice that the door under the main stairway is cracked open. It leads down into further darkness. 

Where to next? 

[[Upstairs-&gt;Upstairs Landing]] 

[[Downstairs-&gt;Back to Downstairs]] </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="199" name="AngryStuff End" tags="RG badend" position="2172,1455" size="100,100">**END** 

You have turned into a //rougarou!// 
..... and then got yourself stuffed into oblivion by Mammy Vi&#39;s irresistible, and irresistibly FILLING, erm... undead. food. Ghost-food. Food that you can&#39;t chew but you taste it and feel it PLOP into your roomy new werewolf gut and then fill every nook and cranny inside you... 

uurrggg. You just sort of lay there, burping and grunting and panting and... you feel like a big furry ball with your limbs spread out at angles. How disgraceful and demeaning. You are a GREAT BIG MAJESTIC PREDATOR, are you not? 

Mmff. Whatever. You grumble and doze off. 

When you wake up **some time later,** it&#39;s early morning and neither Mammy Vi nor Beau are anywhere to be found. You&#39;ve also digested much of your hearty meal; you can see your abs again, though they&#39;re a little bulged outwards still. The beast feels quite satisfied, and seems eager to... 

to... 

uh-oh. 

It&#39;s that growy, bulgy, bulking feeling all over again from when you first transformed, but... it&#39;s like, almost //airy// now? Puffy feeling. Your massive meal is helping you get bigger, and stronger, but... ohh shit, you&#39;re //fattening up!!// Your pecs are rounding out and getting padded, your entire torso is losing its sexy V-shape and going all barrel-lookin&#39;... everything&#39;s getting softer and you&#39;re just absolutely fucking HUGE. Ugh, your belly, or rather your abs, they just disappear and //balloon// and uggh!! You shudder and growl and you can&#39;t stop it you just... you&#39;re... 
GROSS. A great big PUDGY werewolf. How //embarrassing.// You snarl impotently as you feel and watch your muscular body thickening and padding out. You feel more like a big tubby bear than a werewolf. Fuck, it&#39;s just insulting to your wolfy pride. How intimidating are you going to be now that you&#39;re all round and soft and plush-looking?? 

Ahh well. At least you&#39;ll be able to go a long fucking time without a meal. You can get down to the business of finding something to FUCK in the meantime. You&#39;ll just have to be careful you don&#39;t CRUSH them under your immense heft... 

Except there&#39;s no one else on the island. You roam the estate all day long, and all you find are tons of alligators in the water (you&#39;d try to leave the island but even the beast knows not to fuck with that many alligators in their home turf) and the occasional ghost as the sun starts to set again. Beau&#39;s long gone; his airboat&#39;s missing. He fucked off in a hurry apparently. 

And you can&#39;t turn back human! You don&#39;t know how! 
And the werewolf doesn&#39;t WANT TO. How dare you even think about changing back when you still need to breed? 

Guess you&#39;re going to have to wait for some unsuspecting normal humans to show up on the island again. Luckily you don&#39;t have to wait long... you see a couple boats pull into the dock a few days later. They&#39;ve got equipment... looks like, looks like an //animal control// squad?? 

Hmm. The human in you may be nervous about this, but the beast is ready to IMPREGNATE all those upstart men... hey look, there&#39;s even a woman involved. 

You prepare for a hunt. Time to make some motherfuckin&#39; pups. </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="200" name="WeightFuck End" tags="RG badend" position="2597,1176" size="100,100">Where have you heard that voice... &quot;... //Beau??//&quot; you whisper up at the monster. 

&quot;Hooo, yeah, it&#39;s me,&quot; he giggles. 

You yelp as his two enormous hands reach out and grasp you firmly around your blubbifying body, pulling you out of the pantry (with some difficulty, as you&#39;ve sort of... filled it out). 

He sniffs you, and looks you over. &quot;Hawhaw. HAA! Hahahahaha. Hawhawhaw... damn, son. You done got CHONKY, you did. What&#39;d you do, come up in here and let Mammy toss an entire...&quot; he starts laughing again, &quot;an entire phantom fuckin&#39; COW down your throat?? Haw haw haw...&quot; 

You blush and cringe away from his loud voice and sharp teeth. &quot;She just... she like, shoved her hands inside and...&quot; 

&quot;OHH hahaha. Yeah that&#39;s what she do sometimes if you get too close.&quot; Beau cradles you in one hand and reaches down to give his own solid middle a few pats. &quot;She done that to me at least once that I can remember. Good thing is, when you get fat offa ghost food, it don&#39;t last as long as gettin&#39; fat offa REAL food. But. Heheheh. Since I got you here.&quot; 

&quot;Please don&#39;t... eat me,&quot; you have to say it. You gotta. Just &#39;cuz you&#39;re like 150 pounds heavier doesn&#39;t mean you wanna DIE about it. 

&quot;Oh hell naw, I ain&#39;t gonna eat you. Not now at least,&quot; Beau says with a chuckle. &quot;First of all, even if I COULD fit you in my mouth, which I can&#39;t, you&#39;d make ME get all big n boofy as soon as I digested yo chunky-ass, I guarantee. But also, you&#39;re so damn big...&quot; 

Sheesh, does he gotta put it like that?? 

&quot;... that there&#39;s a real good chance I&#39;d accidentally bite you on the way in. See, I generally swallow my food whole if it&#39;s still alive. If I bit you, I&#39;d turn back into a human, for good, and be forced to spit you out... and then YOU would turn into //le rougarou// instead, and... I just can&#39;t deal with that, ma cher.&quot; 

Beau flips you over and cuddles you close and now you&#39;re REALLY uncomfortable because this is like some &quot;alright, say &#39;no-homo&#39; already&quot; shit. &quot;Mmm. You know. I&#39;mma be honest, I already thought you was kinda cute...&quot; OHHH SHIT. 

&quot;... what are you gonna //do to me,//&quot; you whimper. 

&quot;But nah, NAH, you got all kinda more, pushin&#39; for the cushion, know what I&#39;m sayin&#39;?&quot; He leers down at you. &quot;You probably the fattest boy I ever fucked. Nice &#39;n soft. I kinda like it.&quot; 

&quot;... fucked??&quot; you wheeze. 

[[He&#39;s pulling your pants off.

SOFT.&quot; Beau slides his monstrous werewolf pecker up between your cheeks. You shiver; you can feel it drooling, //slobbering// all over your back like a hungry dog. He sets you down on your feet for a second. 

You at least make an //attempt// at running away. He doesn&#39;t even really try to stop you, he just chuckles, and walks casually behind you. &quot;Aww. Lookit you waddle. C&#39;mere lil buddy. I&#39;mma carry you, it&#39;ll be easier.&quot; 

You whine as you feel his massive, bulging muscles wrap all around you, and he pulls you tight against his furry warm body and OOHHH FUCK THAT AIN&#39;T RIGHT NOW

HE&#39;S INSIDE
HE&#39;S INSIDE

HE&#39;S IN

His big hands rub all over your cushy belly and give you pats and feel your pecs all softened up and round and diddles your nipples

He just SPLOOSHES inside
Just
shoves it RIGHT in

He&#39;s FUCKING you
He&#39;s FUCKING you
FUCK
FUCK
FUCK

You&#39;re on your hands and knees and you&#39;re rocking back and forth and moaning and he&#39;s FUCKING you and you&#39;re being FUCKED and you&#39;ve gotten all FAT with a huge BELLY and there&#39;s a WEREWOLF pumping burst after burst of CUM right into your FAT. HEAVY. BELLY. 

Beau cuddles you close for a second, still stuffed deep inside. &quot;You gonna be my lil fat buddy for awhile, ok?&quot; 

&quot;Ok!!&quot; you wail. 

&quot;You gonna have some pups for me while you got the extra room in your big self.&quot; 

&quot;Ok--WHAT??!?&quot; 

**END** 

You have been FATTENED!

... and FUCKED. 

Unfortunately for any plans you may have had, especially in regards to posting your slender sexy self all over the Internet and getting more subsribers and more ad revenue... you&#39;re... you&#39;re kinda just a big fat boy right now. Which, wouldn&#39;t be so bad, especially not if what Beau said about &quot;ghost fat&quot; being easier to get rid of. You could just go on, show your subscribers the videos you&#39;ve recorded, and explain that you ate some ghost food and it made you big &#39;n THICC

... except, Beau. The werewolf. You kinda belong to him now. You&#39;re much too fat to get away from him. You like to think that if you were at your normal, fightin&#39; weight, you&#39;d be lithe and slippery enough to outwit and outmaneuver his hulking brutish figure. But... you&#39;re so SLOW now. And you&#39;re a big target. And you can&#39;t fit through or past certain things and... it&#39;s just... it sucks. 

And as the days pass, with you being Beau&#39;s captive on the island, you start to get even BIGGER, and you can&#39;t believe it at first but... your gut&#39;s filling up fast, and it&#39;s not just all soft and squishy anymore, but it&#39;s swelling into a great big firm ball, or more like a //globe,// as it were... 

So great. Not only are you FAT now, but you&#39;re... pregnant. 
With a werewolf. Making you even bigger and rounder and heavier. 
And the way Beau&#39;s talking, it sounds like he plans on keeping you around for... quite some time, as his personal little fucktoy. 

Sucks to be you! 
(... or //does// it?)</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="202" name="HoldFat Vo End" tags="RG badend" position="2594,1316" size="100,100">This sucks, this sucks so hard, you&#39;ve got a fucking werewolf chasing you and this is a GREAT time to be full of gassy-ass ghost food that&#39;s making you feel all bloated and gross-- 

You slam down on the ground as one of the werewolf&#39;s hands swipes your legs out from under you. Before you can scramble away, it grabs your ankle and jerks you back. 

&quot;Where ya goin&#39;, boy?&quot; rumbles a familiar voice above you. 

You twist back to look up at the monster. &quot;Beau?! Beau what the fuck man??&quot; 

&quot;Hey c&#39;mon in here,&quot; he chuckles, and one of his hands slaps his iron-hard abdomen. &quot;Lemme keep you safe. There&#39;s //ghosts// about. Heheheh. Haw haw.&quot; 

&quot;No! NO NO NO!!&quot; you scream as he grabs both your ankles and pulls you up. You&#39;re upside down, and then one hand clasps around your entire midriff-- his hands are THAT BIG, yes-- and when you look down you see 

YOUR FEET ARE IN HIS MOUTH

You slide in and you can&#39;t do a thing about it but kick and writhe! His hand squeezes around your chest until you can&#39;t breathe, and when he feels you go limp, he takes his time gulping you down. SLURP up to your knees, GULP up to your waist. 

You reach down as soon as he lets go of you, and try to pound your fists against his snout, or push yourself up and out... but you slide in even further. His teeth are brushing against your pecs and your back. You can feel his big tongue licking up your gut, almost reaching your nipples under your shirt. 

Suddenly you both sort of freeze up and you let out a loud **BUUUURRRRPP** that you&#39;ve been holding in all this time. Ooof. Damn. That felt kinda good. Your abdomen gurgles as it prepares another blast... but when you look down, you see that your entire belly has swollen up into a noticeably rounded dome-shape, like you&#39;ve just guzzled half a keg all by yourself. 

Beau doesn&#39;t seem to notice. He gags a little, and you think for a moment that this might be your ticket out, so you flex up and try to burp again, pounding your chest. 

But Beau brings a hands up and closes it over your head and shoulders, forcing you to slide down, down, DOWN... You yell in terror as you look up and see his mouth close shut, trapping you in darkness, and you feel the muscles in his throat pulse against your body to force you down further. 

You land in his stomach. It feels like a... like the inside of a leathery, dank, humid bag. Which is basically what it is. You don&#39;t feel any burning acids or anything at least. But... 

but you&#39;re in a //stomach!// [[You&#39;ve been SWALLOWED!!-&gt;HoldFat Vo End 2]] </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="203" name="HoldFat Vo End 2" tags="RG badend" position="2726,1316" size="100,100">You sort of start to cry. 

You&#39;re miserable and you&#39;ve been swallowed by a werewolf-- who you THOUGHT was a nice friendly down-home country boy who you could have a working-class relationship with and use as a contact-slash-tour-guide for the area but ohh NOOO, he&#39;s gotta be a big fucking stupid WEREWOLF doesn&#39;t he!!

And that fucking PIE the ghost in the kitchen fed you. Fuck! You reach down and feel your stomach. It&#39;s gurgling non-stop, churning and roiling with what feels like... just, gas and bubbles and weight. Ugh. You **burp** again. Damn. At least THAT kinda makes you feel better. You were kind of hoping that when your belly blew up there, it&#39;d make Beau choke and he&#39;d spit you out, but... 

**BEELLLCCHH** ohh shit. Shit. Fuck, that was... a big one. You feel less bloated, but your clothes don&#39;t feel any looser. 

You try to get comfortable in Beau&#39;s gut. You can feel his hand rubbing around on the outside, like... patting and rubbing you. &quot;Go ahead and have a nice nap in there, ma cher,&quot; you hear him say outside. &quot;You gonna help bulk me the fuck UP nah, nice &#39;n HUGE.&quot; 

&quot;You&#39;re ALREADY HUGE you ASSHOLE.&quot; 

&quot;Heheheh. Yeah. But. Heheh... hey what&#39;re you doin&#39; in there anyway?&quot; 

&quot;I&#39;m...**BUUUURRRRPP**&quot; ooff. Your voice trails off; shit, that burp was so powerful it made you cross-eyed for a second there. 

Your eyes get big as you look down at yourself. It&#39;s hard to see, but your sight&#39;s adjusting to the darkness fast, and... you, um. You look. Rather... plump. Fuck it, no, you&#39;re swelling up like some great big bug just stung you. **BURP** ohh crap, //crap,// every time you belch like that, you get even //bigger!!// 

&quot;Hey nah. You stop that shit.&quot; Beau slaps his gut a couple times. Fuck him; you hope he feels painfully bloated because of your presence. 

Your belly rumbles. You place your hands on it, wincing as you realize how... ugh, how FAT you feel. Swollen and puffy and gassy and... 

**BURP** the button on your jeans pops open as your belly engorges. &quot;ShhhHIT,&quot; you gasp. &quot;I&#39;m... I&#39;m getting FAT!!&quot; 

Another loud burp rolls up out of you. Beau protests, but you ignore him. You can only look down at your hands and arms, watching them swell with actual FAT, all chunky and soft, and your body below. Your middle rounds out and plumps like rising dough. You keep BURPING and every time you do it&#39;s like you gain ten more pounds, and... 

And though this makes you rather upset... you can&#39;t help but feel a sense of petty revenge. Because. You&#39;re swelling up INSIDE Beau, like a stack of pancakes does, and... you can only imagine how tight and huge HIS gut is getting with your increasing weight. 

His stomach walls are soft and squishy around you, and you wince, **BELCH**, pat your body as you continue to fatten, and start to doze off. 

**END** 

You... are awake? And definitely not inside Beau anymore. Where are you? 

Hmm. It looks like you&#39;re... outside the mansion? It&#39;s daylight. You hear birds singing, and see lovely sunlight... 

Wait a second what is... HOLY SHIT that&#39;s Beau!!

He&#39;s still a werewolf, lying defeated-looking and asleep on his full gut, just there in the grass. From the way he&#39;s positioned, you think he must&#39;ve tried to leave the house? Only for you to bloat up immensely and throw him to his knees, where he just gave up... 

Hey wait a second. 

You look down at yourself. 

Oh fuck! You&#39;re still all huge and fat and... you reach down and feel your soft, squishy body. Fuck, man, FUUUCK!! You were so slim and light and speedy and agile and you were just... shit, this is bullshit! 

&quot;Ugghhh...&quot; Beau stirs and rolls sideways, then the massive werewolf stands up. He looks around, and then down at himself. &quot;Sumbitch. Did I digest ALL of you??&quot; 

&quot;You... I&#39;m still here, aren&#39;t I??&quot; you scoff. He had to have puked you up or something. 

&quot;Nah, you a damn ghost now, but I--&quot; 

&quot;I&#39;M A WHAT??!?&quot; 

nonononono that can&#39;t be... ohh. Ohh fuck. 
You&#39;re a ghost. 
You look down again and see yourself flicker in and out, going from your normal colors, to a pale ghostly mist. Foggy and off-white and glowing just so. You can see right through your hefty new girth, to the other side. 

&quot;Tarnation fucking DAMMIT,&quot; Beau growls, and you look up, and he&#39;s looking himself over just like you did the night before. In his stomach. 

You start laughing your big undead ass off. //He&#39;s gaining your weight.// &quot;Shut your ass up with that laughin&#39;!&quot; Beau snaps, as he burps and swells up. His big, bulging werewolf muscles become padded and overlaid with soft pudge, particularly his entire midsection-- which was already thickly built like a powerlifter, but NOW he&#39;s getting very, very round. 

&quot;Dammit!&quot; Beau balloons up. &quot;DAMMIT!&quot; His body swells and rounds and //emplumpens.// &quot;MOTHERFUCKER!!&quot; 

And you just giggle. You can&#39;t help it. You&#39;re bummed about being, erm... no longer among the living... but hey, you&#39;re here, aren&#39;t you? 

Well, it sucks, but it&#39;s not all bad. You now haunt the entire island; a big soft ghost boy, floating around looking for things to pretend to eat. You&#39;re almost permanently hungry-- it doesn&#39;t exactly hurt, but it does compel you to put everything in your mouth. And unfortunately for you, whereas ghost-fat gained from ghost-food is fairly easy for LIVING people to shrug off within a few weeks or a month or so... 

You&#39;re kinda stuck with it for the time being. A big soft tubby ghost. Ahh well; at least you made Beau a big soft tubby //werewolf// in revenge. 

The worst part isn&#39;t really being //dead,// per se. It&#39;s being stuck on the island. No one&#39;s ever gonna know what happened to you! Unless someone comes looking for you... There&#39;s been no living people you could try it on, but your ghostly instincts suggest that perhaps you could... 

**InHABit SOMEone&#39;s FLEshly VESSeL** 

if some people would just come to the island. You could go with one of them, and eat some real fuckin&#39; food to get rid of this profane hunger you&#39;ve been cursed with, possibly at the cost of making your HOST immensely hefty unless they have a speedy metabolism... </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="204" name="EarlySleep IW Fuck" tags="IW end" position="1909,1459" size="100,100">You reach back and attempt to get up-- &quot;OHhohHOHOOO&quot; you suddenly let out this absolutely //deranged// wail of pleasure as you start creaming your jeans. Holy SHIT. Why are you so aroused?? From a fuckin&#39; dream? You collapse onto the ottoman again, feeling your dick slop cum all up in your boxers. Ewww. Heheh. 

Fuck. That dream was something else. You can still feel the soft hands clasping your body and pulling you down, //holding// you in place. Mmfff. MMMMm. Your head lolls around as your cum trickles to a stop. Hot damn. 

You cringe. &quot;Nnnggg...&quot; you still feel those sharp ZINGS of pleasure hitting you and your dick is overstimulated and you claw at the ottoman as you try to stand again. Fuckin&#39; hell, your legs are... just, not working. At all. 

&quot;Ahhh... Ahhh!!&quot; you squeal into the ottoman, muffling your voice. What time is it?? Where even ARE you? Why is there... 

HOLY SHIT WHY IS THERE SOMETHING IN YOUR ASS???

&quot;Ahh, ahhhh, ahh, ahh-ahh--AHH...&quot; you buck and try to jump forwards, push yourself away from the chair and the ottoman, but some invisible force jerks you back and squeezes another shot of cum out of you as a ghostly dick probes the inner confines of your belly. 

//You&#39;re being fucked by a ghost!!// 

And your clothes are still on, and you&#39;re just... you&#39;re just laid out sprawled over the ottoman there, all flushed and sweaty and overcooked, grunting and moaning as you feel the ghost railing you. 

&quot;Whhhyyy?? are you doing this??&quot; you manage to squeal out. You get humped HARD for your troubles, yelping loudly. Fuck, you sound like you&#39;re in a porno or something! You NEVER make noises like this when you fuck! 

The humping stops for just a moment, and an otherworldly voice echoes through the room. 

**//A I R//** 

Air?? What the fuck does that have to do with anything? ohh SHEEHSHZHH ITS CUMMIN&#39; IN YOUR GUT that&#39;s fuckin&#39; COLD!! You shiver violently as icy cold ghost spoo gushes inside you, filling your entire abdominal cavity with a chilling presence. 

You collapse once more, flopped over the ottoman like a soaked, used tissue. You make one little attempt at rising, but can&#39;t. You definitely need a moment to catch your breath. 

**LATER** 

You lay there for awhile. What. A night. You can see the sun rising, out through the window on the other side of the room. You groan as you gather yourself back together and realize you didn&#39;t record any of that little... bout of paranormal activity. Which is probably for the best. 

You&#39;re not sure if you want to include THIS in the video, but you definitely need to get the hell off this island, back to some civilization. You manage to record a groggy &#39;it&#39;s the next morning and I didn&#39;t see any more ghosts guys&#39; outtro to the vid, and head off to the boathouse. 

Your stomach feels terrible. You don&#39;t feel like you can eat, and it&#39;s like... ugh. Like there&#39;s just a pile of ice inside you. Heavy and freezing cold and not even the humidity of the day can chase it off. 

Beau takes you back through Bayou Lourde, to where you left your car. 
It&#39;s exactly as you left it. [[You drive off.-&gt;EarlySleep IW Fuck End]] </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="205" name="EarlySleep IW Fuck End" tags="IW end" position="2042,1457" size="100,100">You make it back to your BnB and take a nice shower, get yourself cleaned up. You review your footage, try to think about how you&#39;re going to edit it. It&#39;s not that the trip was a disappointment but... 

but you got. Fucked. By. A. Ghost. 

What are you supposed to do, put it in the vid and hope you don&#39;t get censored and demonetized? 

You&#39;re just watching your last little &#39;good night&#39; portion when you feel an odd, rumbly, fluttering in your lower belly. //Oh great,// you think, //guess it&#39;s time to go ralph.// 

But you don&#39;t. Instead, as you head to the toilet and start to lift the lid, your body gives a big JERK. A big THRASH. Your hips thrust in and out for a second like you&#39;ve just found the world&#39;s best fleshlight; your dick rises to attention... 

and you watch, to your horror, as your stomach rapidly bloats to what you can only describe as a 12-pack of beer... or a first trimester pregnancy. 

You slump against the wall, panting, no //hyperventilating,// as you feel little rolls and flutters and probes deep in your gut. Tenderly, you place your hands on your freshly swollen belly. 

You blink tears out and rasp, to no one in particular: &quot;what. is that.&quot; 

**END** 

You have been SEEDED by an invisible GHOST. 

At first you plan on going completely dark. There is no precedent for this, is there? What if your subscribers get grossed out? What if... what if like the creepy government science agents come to take you and do experiments on you? What if what if what if

But after a couple days of doing your best to pretend like it isn&#39;t there, your belly decides to rapidly gain about three inches in diameter one morning. There&#39;s NO hiding it from anyone who&#39;s familiar with the way you&#39;re supposed to... be shaped. Which is like, all of your subscribers, and your friends and family... 

You don&#39;t have a choice. You&#39;ve got to get video of it. As much as you don&#39;t want to admit to anything that happened... you gotta. 

So you do. 

And it ends up being the right choice, because within a few days of posting the first video (entitled &quot;YOU GUYS I F*CKED A GHOST (GONE SEXUAL!) AND NOW I&#39;M PREGNANT&quot;)... you start to get a LOT of subscribers. 

Like. A lot. 
Lotta... sometimes appreciative, sometimes borderline creepy comments... about your belly swelling up and you getting fucked and who&#39;d fuck you and who else wishes they could, um. Get you pregnant. 

Well how nice. You&#39;ve discovered a new side of the Internet, and made some extra money in the process. 

The only real downside is, you positively //balloon// after about another week of this, looking like a woman carrying twins. It&#39;s not as heavy as it looks but you take up WAY too much space and moving is very difficult. And... and it stops growing. 

It just stops. It... you&#39;re stuck. 

Ohh fuck you&#39;re STUCK FULL TERM PREGNANT WITH A GHOST BABY

... the only thing you can think to do, is head back to Bayou Lourde and... seek out some help? But can you risk it? 

What if you get even MORE pregnant?? </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="206" name="LockedLibrary" tags="" position="1211,1291" size="100,100">You head to the </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="207" name="Study VW Q Start" tags="VW" position="1324,2020" size="100,100">You drop your name and hold a hand out to shake hers. &quot;So I run a channel where I explore supposedly haunted places, and look for evidence of ghosts or anything else paranormal.&quot;

&quot;Well //here,// I&#39;ve definitely... seen some things that are real.&quot; You chuckle. &quot;But most of the time, the places I go and the things I find, are hoaxes, pranks, superstitions, people getting hysterical about leaky pipes and creaky attics. You know. Typical //Scooby-Doo// bullshit.&quot; 

She laughs. &quot;I see.&quot; 

&quot;So what&#39;s your name anyway?&quot; 

&quot;I thought I told you I&#39;d be askin&#39; the questions?!&quot; she says. 

&quot;Sorry, sorry,&quot; you say, and put your smile back up in full force. &quot;Just trying to be friendly.&quot; 

&quot;... and I am Eliza,&quot; she says. &quot;Now. Why do you do, what you do?&quot; 

&quot;... you mean why do I hunt ghosts, or why do I make a show on the Internet about it?&quot; 

Eliza nods. &quot;Yes.&quot; 

Well crap. She doesn&#39;t seem to want to clarify. How do you answer?

To be honest? I kinda hated my old job? But I wasn&#39;t sure what to do, to get out of it. And for awhile there it really sucked, being tied down to my old job when I just wanted to get out and travel and see places further away from home. But I made it work, and kept at it, and built up my subscriber count... so here I am.&quot; 

&quot;Hmm. And do you still work the old job?&quot; 

&quot;No, I was finally able to quit, I&#39;m making decent enough money from my show,&quot; you say. &quot;The cool thing is, even if I never see any ghosts or signs of paranormal activity at all? I still get to show my viewers a lot of really neat abandoned places. Empty houses, factories, hotels, offices, the //hospitals// are always the creepiest to be honest...&quot; 

&quot;Hmm.&quot; Eliza approaches you, and looks up into your face. She&#39;s just a bit shorter than you. &quot;I can respect that, mon. Lots of people don&#39;t tink they can break free of their current situation, so fuck me, they don&#39;t even TRY.&quot; She tosses her hair back as she walks over to a table in the corner. She holds up a piece of chalk. 

&quot;Look, upon the ground where you stand.&quot; 

You look down. You&#39;re in some kind of... pentagram, except it&#39;s not a star. More like a mandala? Drawn in chalk on the wooden flooring. 

Eliza wiggles the chalk in her fingertips, grinning at you. &quot;What if I told you you could step inside, but never leave until the circle was broken?&quot; 

You frown, and stare at the circle for a moment, and then just... step over it. Then you grin over at her. 

&quot;See?&quot; she shrugs. &quot;Such is life. Always people feelin&#39; trapped, not knowin&#39; all they have to do is take a step in a different direction.&quot; 

You open your mouth-- fuck, you have so much you want to ask her! But decide to stay quiet, and [[wait for her next question.-&gt;VW Q Fear]] </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="209" name="VW Q GoodTimes" tags="VW" position="1166,2026" size="100,100">&quot;Well, it&#39;s fun, and I get to travel a lot, I get to see some really cool places-- even if there&#39;s no ghosts, I still get to show off some awesome abandoned structures. Modern-day ruins and stuff.&quot; 

&quot;So you&#39;re doing it for entertainment?&quot; Eliza asks. 

&quot;Weeellll I mean I like getting paid, too, but I&#39;d still hope to do it even if I wasn&#39;t making any money off it,&quot; you shrug. 

&quot;Hmm. Though, with all that goes on in the world today, seems like there would be more productive uses of your time than chasing ghosts, yeah?&quot; 

This feels like a trick question. Your eyebrows furrow a bit. &quot;What, like... working a dead-end job in some big box store somewhere, getting shit on all day by old people who didn&#39;t realize their coupons expired? No thanks. This is way more fun and enjoyable.&quot; 

Eliza nods. &quot;Well that feels like an honest enough answer. Some might interpret that attitude as selfish, but I&#39;d be a hypocrite to deny I don&#39;t have similar reasons to why I&#39;m here practicin&#39; mah sorcery instead of where I was before.&quot; 

Almost by reflex, you open your mouth to ask where she was before, but take a deep breath and [[wait for her next question.-&gt;VW Q Fear]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="210" name="VW Q FinancialAspect" tags="VW" position="1475,1875" size="100,100">&quot;Well you know, I was finally able to quit my old job recently, and I&#39;m actually making a fairly decent living now,&quot; you say. &quot;It&#39;s not enough to start a family, but it&#39;s paying my bills and rent adequately. And I can travel without worrying about missing work, since... I work WHEN I travel, for the most part. It&#39;s just a better situation. Shit, I&#39;m almost debt-free these days. Just a few small things left to finish paying.&quot; 

&quot;You talk like you&#39;ve known some hardship, mon.&quot; 

&quot;Well... I mean I&#39;ve never been on the brink of starvation, or homeless,&quot; you say. &quot;But I&#39;ve definitely had some rough spots.

A lot of times I find a hoax or a prank going on, and I come in all //Scooby-Doo// style and pull the mask off, and...&quot; you shrug. &quot;I mean it&#39;s fun? But I&#39;m just. I just wanna reveal the truth.&quot; 

&quot;Hmm. Sounds like you have a real passion for your work then.&quot; Eliza holds up something that looks kind of like a dreamcatcher, made from sticks and feathers and dried flower petals. &quot;I have similar feelings towards my work.&quot; 

&quot;What&#39;s that thing?&quot; you ask. &quot;Some kinda totem or a ward or something?&quot; 

&quot;An air freshener.&quot; 

&quot;... oh.&quot; 

Eliza laughs at your expression. &quot;Not everything in here is arcane, silly boy.&quot; 

&quot;Oh yeah? So what is?&quot; you ask with a hint of challenge in your tone. 

&quot;Ohohoho be careful with that attitude mon,&quot; Eliza snickers. &quot;Besides, it&#39;s my turn to ask a question again.&quot; 

Well, you can let her ask you another question, or... press the issue if you&#39;re curious... 

[[&quot;Ok ok, fine, haha.&quot;-&gt;VW Q Fear]] 

[[&quot;No for real, I wanna see some actual magic!&quot;-&gt;VW DrinkinGame]] </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="212" name="VW Q BetterLife" tags="VW" position="1610,1761" size="100,100">You rub the back of your neck as you say it. It&#39;s such an innocent thing to say, and yet, why does it sound so lame? &quot;I mean, yeah myself, but family and friends, too. I don&#39;t wanna be one of those guys who gets stuck in a rut, same old shit every day, come home tired from work and just sit on my ass until bed, y&#39;know? Like--&quot; 

&quot;Like //parents,//&quot; Eliza giggles. &quot;Though, mine weren&#39;t like that. But lots are. I once dated a boy who lived with his, still. That was dem, that was his parents mon. Watchin&#39; the same game shows every night, wishin&#39; they could go on the cruises and drive fancy new cars and do fun, luxurious vacations while draggin&#39; themselves back to the same drudge work day after day.&quot; 

&quot;Yeah. I don&#39;t wanna be stuck like that. Always wishing things were better but never able to make it happen.&quot; She tosses her hair back as she walks over to a table in the corner. She then holds up a piece of chalk. 

&quot;Look, upon the ground where you stand.&quot; 

You look down. You&#39;re in some kind of... pentagram, except it&#39;s not a star. More like a mandala? Drawn in chalk on the wooden flooring. 

Eliza wiggles the chalk in her fingertips, grinning at you. &quot;What if I told you you could step inside, but never leave until the circle was broken?&quot; 

You frown, and stare at the circle for a moment, and then just... step over it. Then you grin over at her. 

&quot;See?&quot; she shrugs. &quot;Such is life. Always people feelin&#39; trapped, not knowin&#39; all they have to do is take a step in a different direction.&quot; 

You open your mouth-- fuck, you have so much you want to ask her! But decide to stay quiet, and [[wait for her next question.-&gt;VW Q Fear]] </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="213" name="VW Q Charity" tags="goodend VW" position="1480,1731" size="100,100">&quot;Do you really?&quot; Eliza gives you a funny, almost bewildered sort of frown. &quot;I hadn&#39;t pegged you for the sort. But I wonder... you put me in the mind of an old friend. She wanted to help the poor, feed the hungry, all that good stuff. Shoe the shoeless. Heal the sick. Some of these tings, I can actually do with my magic, or potions... but I don&#39;t work for free.&quot; 

You rub your chin, your arms folding as you consider her. &quot;What are you proposing?&quot; 

&quot;Well I&#39;ve got an idea,&quot; Eliza says. &quot;You&#39;ve got a... hmm, a &#39;platform of influence&#39; by which you can advertise, yeah?&quot; 

&quot;Well yeah...&quot; 

&quot;Perhaps we could make a deal.&quot; You can almost see the dollar signs flashing in her eyes. &quot;I myself, do NOT have such a platform. But I have these.&quot; 

She beckons you over to a fancy cabinet display of... well, you can only call them potions and trinkets and talismans and all sorts of fantastic looking stuff. &quot;We team up, you and I. You gain more subscribers, we ask them to donate, perhaps we do one of those &#39;challenge&#39; things, yeah?&quot; 

&quot;... what would be the challenge?&quot; you ask. 

&quot;Well, some of these potions and amulets do funny tings to a man, ya?&quot; Eliza giggles. &quot;Let&#39;s say you raise $5000 for charity from your subscribers? And you drink one that turns you into a frog for a few hours.&quot; 

You recoil. &quot;WHOA. You can do that?&quot; 

&quot;Or, perhaps you get so many donations, and we send out a few of my elixirs to people who&#39;ve donated, as part of a raffle? And then they get to film themselves drinking and experiencing whatever happens.&quot; 

&quot;... this sounds very dangerous and ethically questionable,&quot; you say, tapping your chin. &quot;But also very fun.&quot; 

&quot;And meanwhile, you get even more attention and subscribers, which means more donations, which means not just more charity but more money for US,&quot; Eliza says. 

Shoot. It does sound like a lot of fun. 

&quot;I&#39;m in,&quot; you say. &quot;Let&#39;s do it.&quot; 

**END** 

You&#39;ve made a deal with a witch! 

And... it&#39;s not a bad one. Though it does completely derail your plans for the night and the upcoming video, sort of. Now, instead of experiencing everything by yourself, Eliza walks you through the house and shows you... EVERYTHING. 

All of the ghosts. And she&#39;s got some different ways to ward them off so none of the more hostile or intrusive ones bother you as she gives you a proper tour. 

And you discuss business with her, and work out a format for your show&#39;s rework: you&#39;re still going to visit haunted places and look for ghosts, but now you&#39;ve got someone much more knowledgeable on the subject to help you find the REAL shit, and see through the hoaxes... and stay safe when you //do// encounter anything angry or vengeful. 

She&#39;s for real, too. You get to know Eliza, and she learns more about you, and just to demonstrate how serious she is, she takes you back to her &#39;lab&#39; and has you try some potions out. 

You turn into a cat, and then back human, whereupon you are inflated to the size of a minivan, then deflated and shrunk down to the size of a AA battery. And then she returns you to normal, but with a dick and balls that are twice as big as they should be. (No, she doesn&#39;t let you KEEP them that way)

It&#39;s the start of a long, eventful, //fruitful// partnership. You&#39;re destined for Internet stardom, and Eliza&#39;s happy to let you take the spotlight while she works from the shadows. 

And you lived happily ever after! 

No for real! 

(Ok seriously though this is the boring goody-two-shoes ending, nothing else kinky-fun beyond this point, but congrats on getting here though!) </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="214" name=" VW Q Luxury" tags="VW" position="1630,1898" size="100,100">&quot;Hmm.&quot; Eliza taps the side of her face. She&#39;s looking at you almost sternly. &quot;At what cost though? After all, you have to spend money, to make money... and many is the rich man who clawed his way to the top, and shredded the dreams of others in the process.&quot; 

&quot;I just wanna be rich. That&#39;s all. I want to be able to do... //things,//&quot; you say. &quot;Whether it&#39;s take a trip or buy something I like the look of, or get medical treatment or pay bills or take my friends out to a club and buy &#39;em drinks all night... I want to have enough money to where I can live a life free of worries and constraints.&quot; 

Eliza nods. She folds her arms. &quot;Well that&#39;s not such a horrible ting to say, mon. Yet you almost sound guilty.&quot; 

&quot;Well it&#39;s hard to talk about wanting to make a lotta money,&quot; you say, &quot;without people assuming you&#39;re greedy or want to take advantage of others, and... I mean you know. Eat the rich and all...&quot; 

&quot;Heh.&quot; Eliza shrugs. &quot;I could probably make a LOT of money with my magic and my potions if I wanted, but... I never make more than I need really.&quot; She gestures towards a cabinet, where you can see all sorts of things on display. Little bottles and vials of colorful liquids, trinkets crafted from nature, talismans, amulets... fantastic looking stuff, really. 

&quot;There&#39;s my currency,&quot; Eliza chuckles. 

You nod. &quot;So what--&quot; 

&quot;Ah ah ah,&quot; Eliza shakes her head at you, pointing at your face. &quot;I&#39;m still askin&#39; the questions mon.&quot; 

You sigh and nod her way, [[waiting for her next question.-&gt;VW Q Fear]] </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="215" name="VW Q Fear" tags="VW" position="1330,2160" size="100,100">Eliza swoops across the room and holds a hand high above her head. She snaps her fingers. The room goes completely dark-- except you didn&#39;t see her touch any lightswitches, and that&#39;s IF this place has power flowing to it, which you highly doubt. 

She didn&#39;t blow out any candles either. 

&quot;What, I ask,&quot; says her voice in your left ear. 

&quot;... do you fear?&quot; she says, in your other ear. 

One by one, a few small candles start to relight around the room. 

&quot;Come. Tell me. What keeps you awake at night. What, of all the tings of this world, haunts your dreams? It can&#39;t be ghosts, I imagine,&quot; she says, and starts to laugh. It sounds like she&#39;s behind you. Except, when she laughs, she&#39;s in front of you. 

Well? What are you afraid of? 

[[Dying horribly and painfully.-&gt;VW Fear-Death]] 

[[Loss of a loved one.-&gt;VW Fear-LovedDeath]] 

[[Living without love.-&gt;VW Fear-NoLove]] 

[[Wasting your life.-&gt;VW Fear-Languish]] </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="216" name="VW Fear-Death" tags="" position="1158,2317" size="100,100">&quot;... dying, I guess,&quot; you say. 

&quot;A common enough source of dread. Almost boring, to hear it from you.&quot; Eliza giggles, but not mockingly. &quot;Do you fear dying in any fashion? Or are you one who wants to go out wit a //bang,// and fear a boring death? Or perhaps...&quot; 

&quot;I guess I fear a slow or painful death, really,&quot; you say. &quot;I mean if I was gonna die, I&#39;d want it to just be quick, and not even realize I&#39;d died.&quot; 

&quot;Makes sense.&quot; You can&#39;t see her, but you can faintly hear her moving through the room. It&#39;s not that big of a room anyway. She&#39;s getting further away. &quot;And of all the tings you could be chasin&#39; in your career, it&#39;s the dead themselves. Do you fear them too?&quot; 

&quot;No, not at all. They&#39;re almost always fake, right?&quot; 

&quot;Hmm, hmm...&quot; Eliza claps her hands. The lights in the room come back on like she&#39;s got them all on clappers; except they&#39;re all candles of course. 

&quot;Well. I think you&#39;ve earned the right to ask me ONE question, now. Just one.&quot; 

Ok... [[what&#39;re you going to ask her?-&gt;VW Q Yours]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="217" name="VW Fear-LovedDeath" tags="VW" position="1168,2165" size="100,100">&quot;... I guess losing a loved one. Someone close to me, just... gone. Forever. And I don&#39;t get them back.&quot; 

You start to think about it. You take in a shuddery breath. Ghosts are NOTHING compared to the thought of someone you love, becoming one. 

The candles alight all at once, but they&#39;re a dark purple color, like blacklights, lighting up the room&#39;s various... ohh. 

//Ohhhh.// How lovely! With the change in lighting you can see colorful swirls and designs that weren&#39;t there before. It&#39;s like Eliza decorated the room with different colors of chalk or paint, covered it in delightful artwork... and then hid it all away for just such moments. It&#39;s breathtaking. It feels colder in the entire room, like there&#39;s been a sudden blast of wintry air. 

&quot;The darkness of the afterlife doesn&#39;t have to be a fearful thing, devoid of its own beauty.&quot; Eliza&#39;s standing in the middle of the room with her arms raised. You can just barely see her. &quot;But that is one of the most common sources of dread I&#39;ve yet to encounter. Phobias or spiders or clowns mean nothing to the pain of losing a beloved soul.&quot; 

The candles all return to their normal flickering flame color, and the room becomes warm once again. 

&quot;I&#39;ve decided you may ask me one question, for now. Only one.&quot; Eliza doesn&#39;t look at you. She dips her finger into a softly bubbling pot and smells it. &quot;Mm. This will be done soon...&quot; 

Welp. Looks like you get to [[ask her a question now...-&gt;VW Q Yours]] </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="218" name="VW Fear-NoLove" tags="VW" position="1491,2292" size="100,100">&quot;Uhh... I guess, never finding someone. Y&#39;know? Never finding a soulmate. Someone to love, but... but also never //being loved.//&quot; 

The lights come back on quite suddenly-- all the candles igniting at once. Eliza&#39;s standing close by, her hand covering her grin. &quot;This isn&#39;t a &#39;I don&#39;wanna die a virgin&#39; ting, is it?&quot; 

&quot;Nono, not like that,&quot; you scoff. &quot;I&#39;m talking... like meaningful relationships. Not lust, not one-night stands, not little flings... I mean I may not be looking for a long-term relationship NOW, but I will eventually, and I just...&quot; you let your voice trail off. What an awkward thing to discuss with a woman you just met. Who looks close to your age, and is hardly ugly at all. 

Hmm. HHhhhmmmmm. 

Eliza lowers her hand. Her smile is warmer now, rather than nearly-mocking. &quot;That&#39;s rather sweet.&quot; 

&quot;So uhh... do I get to ask you some questions too?&quot; you ask. 

&quot;Ya just asked one, boy!&quot; Eliza says loudly. But she giggles. &quot;Ahh well. [[Ask away. ONE question though.&quot;-&gt;VW Q Yours]] 

</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="219" name="VW Fear-Languish" tags="VW" position="1489,2151" size="100,100">&quot;... I guess, wasting my time? My life? Not doing anything important, not being remembered... you know?&quot; You shrug. &quot;Not leaving a mark. Being average and boring.&quot; 

&quot;Hmm... interesting.&quot; Eliza appears from the darkness before you. &quot;Not quite what I expected. Many, many people, are afraid of death itself. But you are afraid of a particular sort of //life.//&quot; 

&quot;I&#39;m not even sure I&#39;d call it &#39;afraid,&#39;&quot; you say with a frown. &quot;It doesn&#39;t necessarily give me nightmares, but it&#39;s like... have you ever had a goal that you devoted your entire life to until you achieved it? It&#39;s like that, but in reverse. I&#39;m dedicating myself to //being something.// Rather than just... an average Joe, like everyone else. Part of the crowd. A statistic.&quot; 

Eliza crosses to the table you saw earlier, with the crystal ball. The candles all flicker back to life at once. &quot;Come. Sit down mon. I&#39;ll let you ask //me// a question.&quot; 

You have a seat and she holds a hand up. &quot;First, pick a card. I already know which one you&#39;re going to pick, but pick anyway so I can confirm I&#39;m right.&quot; 

&quot;... ok?&quot; you say. Your knowledge of tarot is very limited. 

There&#39;s a pile of cards in front of you, scattered. 

You pick the: 

[[First card your hand touches.-&gt;VW Tarot]] 

[[Card furthest from you.-&gt;VW Tarot]] 

[[One from underneath all the rest.-&gt;VW Tarot]] </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="220" name="VW Tarot" tags="VW" position="1638,2179" size="100,100">You look at the card in your hand. 

&quot;The Hermit, isn&#39;t it?&quot; Eliza asks. 

&quot;I... yeah, how&#39;d you do that?&quot; you raise your eyebrows at her. She&#39;s right; it&#39;s //The Hermit//: an old man in a hooded cloak, holding up a lantern. 

She sighs, resting her head against her hand. &quot;You&#39;re not hard to figure out. Lots o&#39; young men, &#39;bout your age. Looking for a purpose in life, looking for their own path, or someone to point it out to them. Looking to become either leaders, or followers.&quot; 

&quot;Is that what this card means?&quot; 

&quot;In a manner of speakin&#39;,&quot; Eliza nods. &quot;For you at least.&quot; 

&quot;I... don&#39;t understand tarot at all,&quot; you say. 

&quot;Well. I&#39;m not askin&#39; you to believe in it, but perhaps as a ghost hunter, you might learn what the cards are, and what they mean, someday.&quot; Eliza waves her hand over the pile of cards. 

They arrange themselves into a neat little stack, fanned out around the crystal ball. 

&quot;It&#39;s all connected. The spirits, the fates.&quot; 

She&#39;s givin&#39; you the old &quot;Madame Psychic&quot; mumbo-jumbo, but... it works here. You fold your arms on the table and lean in. &quot;So do I get to ask you somethin&#39; now?&quot; 

&quot;Ask away,&quot; she nods. 

Hmm. 
[[What to ask her?-&gt;VW Q Yours]] </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="221" name="VW Q Yours" tags="VW" position="1332,2326" size="100,100">Hmm. You only get one question, at least for now. What could you ask her about? 

[[Hostile spirits and ways to ward them off.-&gt;Ghost Ward VW]] 

[[The previous residents of the house.-&gt;Library Direct VW]] 

[[Her purpose here.-&gt;VW Intentions]] 

[[Her magical implements and ingredients.-&gt;VW Practice]] 

Maybe you&#39;ll get to ask her another question later though... </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="222" name="Ghost Ward VW" tags="VW" position="1166,2455" size="100,100">&quot;So... ok. If there&#39;s hostile spirits in the area, how do I //actually// keep them from you know, hurting me, attacking me, and so on?&quot; 

&quot;Well certain tings can be used to repel them, but it&#39;s just like bug spray-- it doesn&#39;t always work.&quot; Eliza shrugs. &quot;For example if you shook some salt around you in a little circle. The ghost might find a way in, if it&#39;s powerful enough to do things like move the floor beneath you or cause a gust of wind. Certain totems and talismans as well, might frighten away some ghosts, but not others.&quot; 

&quot;So there&#39;s not really a catch-all.&quot; 

&quot;Nope.&quot; Eliza pops her &#39;p&#39; at the end. &quot;There&#39;s often much guesswork to be done beforehand, because many ghosts don&#39;t just tell you what they want, why they&#39;re still here, why they haven&#39;t moved along to the next plane of existence. But what can help, is if you are able to study their life first. For example,&quot; she says while gesturing towards a door in the corner of the room, &quot;there are some books in the library there, that talk about the people who owned this plantation. Some of them stayed here long after death, and may try to have their way with you.&quot; 

&quot;Are any of them like, murderous?&quot; 

&quot;None that I&#39;ve encountered. They prefer to fuck with you in other ways...&quot; Eliza grins. &quot;The cook, downstairs, for example. She lived alone for many years, the only person to occupy this entire estate. In life her purpose was to feed everyone, but then suddenly, she had no one to feed, no one to live with or love... and her death was most unpleasant.&quot; 

You decide not to inquire further about the ghost in the kitchen. &quot;So if you can learn about the person, you can use that knowledge to your advantage to keep them from fucking around with you.&quot; 

&quot;Right.&quot; 

Eliza falls silent for a time. Then she frowns across the table at you. &quot;You know. You seem a smart boy. Perhaps if you come across any ghosts in your travels-- any REAL ones-- you make an attempt to help them out? Even the most hostile of spirits is trapped with us, and would be better off free from this plane.&quot; 

&quot;... I&#39;ll try, I mean... if it&#39;s within my abilities.&quot; 

She stares you down, then [[prepares to ask another question.-&gt;VW Q Desire]] </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="223" name="Library Direct VW" tags="VW" position="1316,2475" size="100,100">&quot;What can you tell me about the people who used to live here?&quot; you ask. 

&quot;Ha! Hahaha. There&#39;s not enough time in the night to discuss the muddled affairs of the families who occupied this house.&quot; Eliza shakes her head at you. &quot;I will tell you two places to look, for the answers you seek there. Both are rooms on this floor. 

&quot;The first, is right next door,&quot; she says, and points at a door you hadn&#39;t really noticed among all the clutter. It&#39;s in the far corner of the room, near the wall with the windows. &quot;That&#39;s the library, and I keep a lot of my research materials there. You&#39;re free to read whatever you like, but there are some books that you might do well to judge by their covers, and let lie. 

&quot;The second, is the room at the far end of the hall,&quot; Eliza says. &quot;The one with the nasty stains around the door.&quot; 

&quot;... what&#39;s in it?&quot; you say. &quot;A murder scene?&quot; 

&quot;Ha! More like a slow suicide scene, mon,&quot; Eliza says. &quot;The mansion&#39;s original owner locked himself in and... from what I can tell, spent the rest of his days eating and drinking and being a layabout. His family got all fucked up near the end, and he just didn&#39;t feel like living anymore, I believe.&quot; 

&quot;Huh. Ok then...&quot; You start to stand. 

&quot;Ah ah,&quot; she says, waving at you to sit back down. &quot;I&#39;m not done with you yet, you&#39;re special. No one else be comin&#39; up in here //alone// like you did, and unafraid of haunted grounds. I have more questions for you.&quot; 

&quot;Well alright... will I get to ask you some more questions too?&quot; 

&quot;Perhaps,&quot; Eliza says. Her eyes twinkle with mischief and she [[asks her next question-&gt;VW Q Desire]] </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="224" name="VW Intentions" tags="VW" position="1509,2577" size="100,100">&quot;Hmm. Uhh. I guess, I wanna know: why are you //here?//&quot; you ask, and you try to make it sound polite. &quot;I mean, is it just for privacy? Since you&#39;re practicing magic?&quot; 

Eliza&#39;s brow furrows. &quot;What do you mean?&quot; 

&quot;Like of all the places to set up shop and make potions and do voodoo, or whatever you prefer to call it,&quot; you say. &quot;This place is remote, it&#39;s on an island, there&#39;s no power or hot water, emergency services would have a helluva time reaching you if you needed them... why not practice your craft in town somewhere?&quot; 

&quot;Ohhhh I see,&quot; Eliza nods. She taps the side of her head. &quot;Privacy, yes, but not so much for the magic mon. This, I //could// set up in town, rent a little shop building of my own, I&#39;m sure. Tourists would love it. Evangelicals would hate it. Other sorcerers and witches and probably lotsa college-aged hippie girls would flock from miles around. And I don&#39;t suppose I&#39;d mind.

&quot;But keeping my research private, that&#39;s what I care most about. Out here, I know for sure that whatever discoveries I make,&quot; Eliza says, and she reaches over and pats a stack of leather-bound books. &quot;They stay with me, until I&#39;m ready to reveal them to whoever&#39;s worthy.&quot; 

&quot;Ok,&quot; you nod. &quot;See I figured maybe, you were being persecuted or something. Like medieval times.&quot; 

&quot;Mmmmm.&quot; Eliza doesn&#39;t indicate agreement or disagreement to what you just said. 

[[Change the subject.-&gt;VW IntentionSuc]]

[[Ask her to elaborate.-&gt;VW Prying]] </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="225" name="VW Practice" tags="VW" position="1483,2422" size="100,100">&quot;Hmm. What to ask you...&quot; you look around the room. There&#39;s just so much to look at: all her little items, some of them probably mundane, but ANY of them could involve her practice of magic. 

&quot;I guess,&quot; you finally say, &quot;I&#39;d like to know more about all this stuff. Your uhh, &#39;practice,&#39; here. What can you tell me about it?&quot; 

&quot;That&#39;s a rather vague question,&quot; Eliza snickers. &quot;We&#39;d be here long into the morning, mon, while I explained tings to ya. Why don&#39;t you pick something more specific and ask me about that? It&#39;ll be easier for both of us.&quot; 

&quot;Crud. Uhhh, well...&quot; you study the room a bit longer. 

A few things catch your eye: 

[[The ornate cabinet-&gt;VW A Cab]] with all the little potion bottles and hanging trinkets.

The table across the room with the scattered ingredients, the mortar and pestle, and the [[small pot on the bunsen burner-&gt;VW A Pot.]] 

The rack hanging on the wall with little figures you can only assume are [[voodoo dolls-&gt;VW A VooDoll]] until told otherwise. 
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="226" name="VW Q Desire" tags="VW" position="1331,2708" size="100,100">&quot;What I want to know next, is: what do you //desire// from life?&quot; 

You think for a moment, and try to decide what to say. 

[[Always be having fun.-&gt;VW Desire Hedon]] 

[[Be rich and make lots of money.-&gt;VW Desire Wealth]] 

[[Get famous and have lots of influence-&gt;VW Desire Fame]] 

[[Sex, sex, and more sex.-&gt;VW Q TehSmex]]  </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="227" name="VW IntentionSuc" tags="VW" position="1678,2764" size="100,100">You shrug. &quot;Anyway. I just want to make it clear that the only thing //I&#39;m// here for is shooting footage and pictures for a video. I&#39;m not here to take anything or bother anyone.&quot; 

&quot;Mmm. So I gather you don&#39;t have much experience with //real// ghosts, then,&quot; Eliza says. &quot;Most have been fake?&quot; 

&quot;Unfortunately.&quot; You sigh and run your fingers through your hair. &quot;That&#39;s why I&#39;m so excited to be here; this is the REAL shit. No tricks.&quot; 

&quot;No tricks.&quot; Eliza clicks her nails against the crystal ball on the table. It turns green. 

You lower your head to look underneath it, and realize that not only is there no color-changing bulb hidden under it, but it&#39;s also floating. You didn&#39;t even realize before; you hadn&#39;t looked hard enough. 

You gaze into it. &quot;If I look long enough... will I see anything?&quot; 

&quot;Heheh. You might, if you have a moment of clear sight. I wouldn&#39;t count on it though.&quot; 

You keep staring at the orb. &quot;There&#39;s just... so much I wanna ask you, but... I don&#39;t want to seem like I&#39;m intruding, you know.&quot; 

&quot;Hmm. Then [[I shall ask YOU another question,&quot;-&gt;VW Q Desire]] she says. </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="228" name="VW Prying" tags="VW" position="1797,2443" size="100,100">&quot;Something DID happen, didn&#39;t it,&quot; you say with a growing smile. &quot;Did you have to cast spells on people?&quot; 

&quot;Hey now. It don&#39;t exactly work like that,&quot; Eliza chuckles. &quot;This ain&#39;t //Harry Potter//, mon.&quot; 

&quot;I bet it&#39;s a good story though!&quot; you say. 

&quot;If I told ya, I&#39;d have to keep ya,&quot; Eliza says, shaking her head, but smiling. 

&quot;Ohh, shit,&quot; you say with fascination. &quot;One of those &#39;I&#39;d have to kill you&#39; things?&quot; 

&quot;No, mon, not //kill,// I can&#39;t do much wit a dead body now.&quot; 

You&#39;re not sure if she&#39;s serious. A couple of interesting scenarios are running through your mind. How do you respond to her? 

[[&quot;So was it something to do with Beau?&quot;-&gt;VW PRY Beau]] 

[[&quot;Were you makin&#39; voodoo zombies or something?&quot;-&gt;VW PRY VZ]] 

[[&quot;Did the police get involved?&quot;-&gt;VW PRY Cops]] 

[[Or, just let it be.-&gt;VW Withdraw Pry]] </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="229" name="VW Q TehSmex" tags="VW" position="1496,2841" size="100,100">&quot;... well at the end of the day? I just wanna fuck.&quot; You shrug and stand up a bit, arms pushing off the table. &quot;I want sex. I want SOMEONE waiting for me every night. Maybe multiple someones.&quot; 

Eliza frowns. &quot;Hmm. If that&#39;s the case, I wonder if you might hear a proposal. A little... shall we say, job offer? Not really for money but I&#39;d be willing to bestow... substantial endowments, let&#39;s say. In exchange for your services.&quot; 

You hold for a moment and think her words over. &quot;... what are you talking about?&quot; 

&quot;Well, hmm.&quot; Eliza swipes at her smartphone for a moment. &quot;You see, you&#39;ve got experience with travel and unfamiliar places, and much more intelligence than Beau, who, let&#39;s face it, is quite the simple boy.&quot; She looks up at you, and for a moment she doesn&#39;t seem like a witch in a tanktop practicing voodoo deep in the swamp. She seems like a businesswoman. Even her accent sounds somewhat reduced. 

&quot;You want me to... travel for you?&quot; you ask. 

&quot;Sort of. I have a network of source that have clued me onto some unique... shall we say, &#39;items.&#39; That I&#39;d like to procure. But I can&#39;t leave my post here,&quot; Eliza says. &quot;I&#39;d like you to get them for me. I&#39;ll send ya places, like &#39;mission control&#39; to your secret agent-- often places where supernatural activity may be taking place, so that works out a plus for both of us. You get to look for ghosts for your show, but in secret you&#39;ll find the items I&#39;m looking for, and bring them back to me. And in exchange...&quot; 

She sits back in her chair and smirks. &quot;Well let&#39;s just say if you work for me, you&#39;ll soon be rolling in pussy and ass and whatever other //holes// you&#39;d like to fill.&quot; 

&quot;But no money, right?&quot; you say. 

&quot;Right. Magic, not money.&quot; Eliza snaps her fingers and for just a second, your penis is ROCK hard. And then you&#39;re limp again. &quot;Get the shit I want, and I&#39;ll make you into a //fuckin&#39; machine.// Or, if you&#39;d rather not, we can just forget I ever said anything. I can always fall back on Beau, I suppose.&quot; 

&quot;Huh.&quot; You prop your face against your hand and look around the room, pondering. 

Do you want to hear more? 

[[Nah, this sounds shady. Back out.-&gt;VW Q HimOffer Nope]] 

[[Yeah, why not? Sounds fun!-&gt;VW Q HimOffer YEP]] </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="230" name="VW A Cab" tags="VW" position="1933,2153" size="100,100">&quot;Uhh... ok, how about this,&quot; you clap your hands and then point at the cabinet. &quot;What kinds of stuff you got in there?&quot; 

Eliza raises her eyebrows at you, then shrugs. &quot;Well... medicine.&quot; 

&quot;... Medicine, huh?&quot; you ask. 

&quot;Not what you&#39;d call modern-day medicine, I suppose,&quot; she says, starting to smirk. &quot;You know the word doesn&#39;t just refer to bottles of pills.&quot; 

&quot;I guess so?&quot; 

&quot;For example, some tings are disinfectants, but not necessarily for viruses or bacteria,&quot; and she gets up and opens the glass doors. She holds up a little red bottle. &quot;Should there be imps about, sprinkling this around will drive them off.&quot; 

&quot;... //Imps,//&quot; you say, and this time you raise YOUR eyebrows. 

&quot;Yah, mon! Little demons! They&#39;re pests basically. They like to do shit like, steal your socks so you don&#39;t have a complete pair, or hide spiders in your shower. Petty bullshit like that.&quot; She puts the red bottle back and picks up a green one. &quot;And this--&quot; 

&quot;Repels gremlins?&quot; you ask, grinning. 

&quot;//Mosquitoes,// silly boy.&quot; Eliza hefts the bottle; it&#39;s a bit larger than most of the others. &quot;If I were interested in being a rich bitch, this alone would pay the bills.&quot; 

&quot;And all the little like, dreamcatchers, totems, fetish items?&quot; you gesture at the various trinkets hanging around the cabinet. 

&quot;Charms, for good luck, or to repel evil spirits, or to hang in your car to make it smell nicer,&quot; Eliza says. 

&quot;Hmm. So you mix the magic stuff with the, uh. Not-magic stuff.&quot; 

&quot;A versatile portfolio, no?&quot; Eliza giggles. &quot;Some of them are even for more... entertaining purposes.&quot; 

&quot;Oh REALLY,&quot; you say, and you stand up a bit, starting to smile. &quot;Care to elaborate?&quot; 

[[&quot;Ohh, well...&quot;-&gt;VW Potion Test]] she taps her fingers on the glass, narrowing her eyes at you. </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="231" name="VW A Pot." tags="VW" position="1645,2531" size="100,100">&quot;What about that? Is that how you make potions and stuff?&quot; you ask, pointing at the table with the mortar and pestle. 

&quot;Well you know what a mortar &#39;n pestle is, right? Helps me grind up ingredients. And then I toss &#39;em into the pot here,&quot; Eliza says, and she picks up a wooden ladle and a little cup. She ladles some of the pot&#39;s contents into the cup and brings it over to you. &quot;Now don&#39;t DRINK this, it&#39;s not for drinkin&#39; mon. Just take a nice deep breath.&quot; 

You look down at the murky, pleasant-smelling liquid in the cup. It steams up in your face and smells super nice... and you inhale, and just... 

wow. 

it&#39;s like taking a hit of dank-ass weed, but without the goofy, happy, laugh-at-everything feeling that starts to well up after you&#39;ve smoked a bit. It&#39;s just the nice calmness, serenity... so chill, man. You set the cup on the table and lean slightly over it for a few minutes, breathing deeply. You feel so calm and relaxed. Yet you&#39;re not //high,// you&#39;re sober as can be, and you feel such a brilliant sense of clarity... 

Eliza shrugs. &quot;This is nothing special really. Just something I like to have around. I&#39;m planning on figuring out how to mix it into candles or something. Imagine havin&#39; some of this around your house when you&#39;re feelin&#39; stressed!&quot; 

&quot;It&#39;s awesome,&quot; you say simply, and lay your head down on your arms, smiling. 

&quot;Well don&#39;t go to sleep on me,&quot; Eliza chuckles as she sits down next to you. &quot;Gonna ask you a question now.&quot; 

[[&quot;Sure, sure,&quot; you say happily.-&gt;VW Q Desire]] </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="232" name="VW A VooDoll" tags="VW" position="1642,2412" size="100,100">You gesture towards the rack of... dolls. Very clearly dolls, but crudely made. They look like scraps of cloth and fabrics from a craft store, like leftovers and scraps, that someone twisted and tied into little people-shapes. 

&quot;So. Those.&quot; 

&quot;They&#39;re exactly what you tink they are, yep,&quot; Eliza chuckles. &quot;But unbound, unclaimed. Inert, you might say.&quot; 

&quot;Real voodoo dolls, huh?&quot; you say, starting to stand. &quot;Can I--&quot; 

&quot;Sit back down silly boy,&quot; Eliza laughs. &quot;I&#39;ll bring ONE to you and let you check it out.&quot; 

She brings a doll to the table. It&#39;s about the size of a stick of deodorant, easily fits in the palm of your hand. A little floppy. Might have some kind of beans inside? Or other plant material. The fabric&#39;s a gentle blend of blue and green, stitched together with gold threads. It gives and flops when you poke it in various ways, but it DOES feel like there&#39;s some sturdier stuff inside that makes it hold a proper shape. It&#39;s not JUST a Beanie Baby, basically... 

&quot;So did you make this yourself?&quot; you ask. &quot;And how come there&#39;s no pins in it?&quot; 

&quot;Ehh, pins are primitive. Pins are for causing pain and discomfort. Better to just use your fingers.&quot; Eliza taps her fingernails on the table. &quot;And yeah mon, I made all of &#39;em.&quot; 

&quot;But they don&#39;t work?&quot; you say as you inspect the doll. &quot;So are you like, saving &#39;em for something?&quot; 

&quot;Eh. Plannin&#39; on sellin&#39; them to people.&quot; She sighs. &quot;So... wanna try it out?&quot; 

&quot;What, like on you?&quot; you ask with a grin. 

&quot;No, goofy boy. On you.&quot; 

&quot;... you wanna //voodoo// me?&quot; you chuckle. 

&quot;Yeah, it doesn&#39;t hurt,&quot; Eliza laughs as well. She holds her hand out. &quot;Give it here, I&#39;ll activate it.&quot; 

You slowly hand it to her, ready to jerk it back if you smell shit. &quot;What&#39;re you gonna //do// to me though?&quot; 

&quot;Mmm... maybe tickle ya pickle a little, just for fun...&quot; 

Oh shit. &quot;Hands-free?&quot; you say with raised eyebrows, [[and put the doll in her hands.-&gt;VW Voodoo Doll Start]] </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="233" name="VW PRY Beau" tags="VW" position="1969,2582" size="100,100">&quot;Do you want me to summon Beau up in here so he can tell you about it instead?&quot; Eliza asks. There is just a //hint// of a threat in her voice now. &quot;I&#39;m sure he won&#39;t mind explaining what happened, but he&#39;ll also be wantin&#39; to put a WEREWOLF BABY in yo&#39; TUMMY, so you&#39;ll have to pay the price for curiosity.&quot; 

Well THAT&#39;s a thing to keep in mind. &quot;Uhh, nevermind!&quot; you say quickly, smiling and putting your hands up. &quot;We can talk about something else.&quot; 

[[&quot;Good...&quot; Eliza says.-&gt;VW Withdraw Pry]]  </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="234" name="VW PRY VZ" tags="VW" position="1971,2433" size="100,100">&quot;Zombies aren&#39;t dead, goofy boy!&quot; Eliza scoffs at you. 

&quot;What do you mean they&#39;re not... ohhhh //right,//&quot; you say. &quot;I guess I was thinking of that one movie.&quot; 

&quot;That movie&#39;s wrong. All the movies are pretty much wrong,&quot; Eliza rolls her eyes. &quot;Stupid, wrong, and disrespectful Hollywood is! Zombies are //alive,// they are just enthralled. Very, very strong hypnosis and hallucinogens.&quot; 

&quot;Riiight. I was thinking about the typical brain-eaters.&quot; 

&quot;Stupid,&quot; Eliza just shakes her head. &quot;The product of overactive imaginations and hysteria. With some religious zealotry t&#39;rown into the mix, mon.&quot; 

&quot;Hmm.&quot; 

[[The two of you fall silent for a moment.-&gt;VW Withdraw Pry]] </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="235" name="VW PRY Cops" tags="VW badend" position="1949,2286" size="100,100">Eliza sighs and tosses her hands up in the air as she gets to her feet. &quot;Alright, alright. I&#39;mma show you mon. Come over here to the window.&quot; 

You get up to follow her. She waves you along and when you get to the window, she stands next to you with a hand on your back to direct your gaze. 

&quot;You see that?&quot; she points. 

It&#39;s hard to make out in this darkness, but she seems to be pointing at an area of the island that looks darker than the rest. &quot;That... dark spot?&quot; 

&quot;Ah-huh,&quot; she nods slowly. &quot;Used to be a place of protection and healing. An ancestor of mine designated it sacred, and protected it from harm with his craft. Beautiful little totems, he would make.

&quot;One day some idiot college boys came here. They&#39;d won some stupid sports game, and wanted to throw a party. They saw the carvings and decorations and all the lovely works of my great grandfather. They thought it be a nice place to have a kegger, a bonfire.&quot; 

She steps back. You glance at her for a moment; she&#39;s hunched over a nearby table. &quot;The dumb boys didn&#39;t listen when I asked them to leave, and their party raged on into the night. Loud and obnoxious. But I tolerated them.&quot; 

You stare out into the night, at the treeline. You can see it now; there&#39;s a circle of trees that&#39;s been burnt up, and then the darkness sort of stops with the trees at the edges only half-burnt. Just a great big circle of ash and charcoal. 

You can almost imagine the party itself. Typical fratbros, most likely. Not a care in the world. &quot;So... they started a fire?&quot; 

Eliza&#39;s back at your side. &quot;And it contained itself entirely in the protective spellwork.&quot; 

You step back, horrified at the implications. Eliza&#39;s hand is between your shoulder blades. You look over at her. &quot;They all burned then?&quot; 

&quot;There was nothing I could do. And as you can imagine, the authorities will blame me if they ever find out any further information. They will come for me, and I&#39;ll have to leave, or defend myself...&quot; Eliza nods at the crystal ball table. &quot;Come. [[Let&#39;s sit back down.&quot;-&gt;VW Shrinking]] </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="236" name="VW Withdraw Pry" tags="VW" position="1803,2596" size="100,100">You just shrug. &quot;Well, uhh. We can just change the subject then.&quot; 

&quot;I&#39;d appreciate that,&quot; Eliza says. She taps her nails on the crystal ball and stares into it for a moment. &quot;This one&#39;s fate is so cloudy tonight.&quot; 

You&#39;re sure she&#39;s just trying to scare you, get you to let your guard down. You just sit quiet and wait for her to speak again. 

Soon enough, [[she does.-&gt;VW Q Desire]] </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="237" name="VW Shrinking" tags="VW badend" position="2094,2291" size="100,100">You shrug and follow her back, but she stops and glances back at you first. &quot;By the way, what made you decide to come here alone? Is that just how you operate?&quot; 

&quot;Oh yeah,&quot; you say. &quot;I mean I occasionally collab with other people, but that&#39;s part of my... image, I guess. I go places alone and confront scary shit, and my subscribers always make jokes about the size of my balls.&quot; You chuckle. 

Eliza nods. She leans back against the crystal ball table, her fingers tracing her mouth. &quot;And do you ever go armed or with some way to get ahold of say, emergency services?&quot; 

It&#39;s an unusual question. Slightly alarming. You shrug. &quot;I mean what&#39;s a gun or a knife gonna do against a ghost? But sometimes, if I&#39;m in a bad area to start with, I bring a knife or some kinda bludgeon. Baseball bat maybe?

&quot;And as far as people knowing where I go? I always make sure someone knows what I&#39;m up to,&quot; you say. &quot;Just in case. And I mean, I&#39;ve got... almost a million subscribers? So it&#39;s not like I&#39;d just disappear, and...&quot; 

Fuck. She&#39;s looking at you kinda funny. You keep cool but, something about her just seems to have //increased// like... you can&#39;t put a finger on it. You&#39;re officially alert. 

&quot;You know,&quot; Eliza says, slowly, &quot;I think we can work out a deal here.&quot; 

&quot;Uh. What&#39;d you have in mind?&quot; you say. 

Is she like... wait a second. Wasn&#39;t she shorter than you a few minutes ago? Holy crap, is she //turning into something??// 

She doesn&#39;t look any different, just for some reason you perceive her as bigger. Fuck, she&#39;s at your eye level, no wait-- she&#39;s taller than you?? 

Eliza starts to laugh, in genuine, tickled-the-funny-bone amusement. &quot;Figured it out yet, mon?&quot; she asks in a small voice. 

Oh hell. 

[[//You are shrinking.//-&gt;VW Shrink End]] 
you are starting to shrink. you don&#39;t notice at first, but you start to realize that things look a little bigger-- Eliza, for example, is suddenly your height, and then she&#39;s a little //taller// than you and you think she&#39;s growing but then in the next scene you really start to shrink down, and then you&#39;re her new pet. </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="238" name="VW Shrink End" tags="VW badend" position="2235,2298" size="100,100">&quot;Eliza. Eliza what&#39;s... hey, you can STOP THIS anytime,&quot; you say quickly as you look around and realize the entire room is getting bigger around you. 

She waggles her fingers at you and gets bigger, and you can FEEL it now, your entire body tingling, buzzing slightly. Kinda feels like there&#39;s pillows pressed on every inch of your skin, squishing you down and compressing you inwards. &quot;I said, I&#39;ve got a deal for you.&quot; 

You don&#39;t even know what to do-- [[run, maybe??-&gt;VW RunOptionShrink]] 

Strike up a deal?? [[VW Shrink End 2]] </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="239" name="VW RunOptionShrink" tags="VW badend" position="2240,2168" size="100,100">You turn and run for the door. You stumble over your own feet. You&#39;re shrinking faster now, in little spurts, like your body&#39;s trying to resist it. You&#39;ll gain an inch or so, but then lose three or four at once. 

And you slam into the door. It&#39;s locked. You kick it, but you&#39;re nowhere near your original size and can&#39;t put the proper amount of strength and weight into your attack. 

&quot;No deal, hmm?&quot; Eliza trills. 

You turn back to her, starting to panic. &quot;Make it STOP!!&quot; 

[[&quot;Why don&#39;t you listen to my proposal?&quot;-&gt;VW Shrink End 2]] </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="240" name="VW Shrink End 2" tags="VW badend" position="2086,2168" size="100,100">&quot;What. Fucking. Deal?!&quot; 

&quot;Easy,&quot; Eliza says. She steps up to you. You feel like a child. And you&#39;re shrinking faster and faster. It&#39;s like the opposite of growth spurts. 

Shrink
your clothes hang off you

Shrink
your pants fall down

Shrink
an inch or two lost

your phone falls out of your pants
Everything is way too big
a few more inches lost

She reaches down for you and picks you up, like a baby. And you are STILL GETTING SMALLER. &quot;You are going to be a good boy. A good pet. And I won&#39;t kill you for learning the truth.&quot; 

&quot;PET??!&quot; 

&quot;Yes. A cute pet. A good small boy.&quot; Eliza clutches you in her hand like a doll. You&#39;re about as tall as a coffee mug now, easily fitting into her grip. She rubs your head with a finger. She&#39;s petting you. 

&quot;... for how long??&quot; you whimper. 

&quot;Ohh, I don&#39;t know. We&#39;ll see.&quot; 

**END** 

You have been SHRUNK to about, ohh... 4-5 inches tall? You are TINY. Eliza walks you over to her crystal ball table, and sets you down. You are nude. You can see your reflection in the ball. You look utterly traumatized, and embarrassed... 

&quot;How did you even...&quot; 

&quot;Shh. A magician never reveals her secrets,&quot; Eliza says. &quot;My goodness you&#39;re adorable. I wanna watch you eating little fruits like strawberries and grape. I wanna make you a little house and bed to sleep in.&quot; 

She steps back, looks you over, holds her hands up as though she&#39;s about to hang a picture. &quot;You&#39;ll need a cute little... oh! A pair of SHORTS. Or a loincloth. Maybe a little cape or scarf. Fuck me, mon, I haven&#39;t had a reason to knit anything in ages. This&#39;ll be so much fun.&quot; 

She pulls out her own smartphone and makes a call. &quot;Hey. C&#39;mon up in here, big guy. I gotta new pet to show you.&quot; 

You cringe, and sink down into a curled-up little ball, hugging your knees to your chest. What are you gonna do now? 

As you sit there feeling sorry for yourself, a few moments pass, and then the door flings wide open. There&#39;s a gigantic black shape standing there, and it enters the room carefully ducking under the doorframe. A werewolf! A monster! But then it twitches, violently spasming out as if having an episode, and with each jerk and shudder, turns back into a man. 

Soon Beau is standing there in his raggedy overalls, panting. &quot;Dammit I hate that spell you put up. Jerks me outta the beast all rude-like.&quot; 

&quot;Sorry mon. Look at him though!&quot; Eliza says. She reaches for you, grasps you firmly in her hand, and holds you out to him. &quot;Look how cute!&quot; 

&quot;Heh. Heheheh! Hawhaw. Damn.&quot; Beau&#39;s face is enormous as he looks closer at you. &quot;I was hopin&#39; to catch n&#39; fuck. Guess I&#39;ll have to find someone else to gimme some pups.&quot; 

&quot;Ehh, you may still get the chance.&quot; Eliza grins down at you, clinging to her thumb, terrified as your feet dangle below. &quot;I can always return him to his normal size, if he&#39;s a good boy... or a //naughty boy...//&quot; </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="241" name="VW Potion Test" tags="VW" position="2226,2031" size="100,100">&quot;Why don&#39;t we play a game?&quot; Eliza says with a sly grin. She opens the cabinet up and waves her hand over the bottles inside, like a game show host. &quot;You test one of my potions for me, I document any fun effects, and in return I&#39;ll help you out with a little problem you&#39;re sure to encounter somewhere on this floor of the mansion.&quot; 

&quot;Fun effects. Hmm. Are you up in here makin&#39; witchy Viagra or something?&quot; you ask. 

&quot;You&#39;ll find out,&quot; Eliza says. She turns to the cabinet and starts rummaging through the bottles, looking at some, putting them back, or choosing them. &quot;Some are for fun in the bedroom... others may be fun to slip into a roommate&#39;s coffee in the morning as a prank... or leave on a snobby coworker&#39;s desk, baked into a brownie...&quot; 

She places five bottles on the crystal ball table, swaps them around a bit, then steps back and produces a little dropper, which she hands to you. &quot;I&#39;m going to turn around so I don&#39;t get to see which one you pick. That way it&#39;ll be a surprise to both of us.&quot; 

&quot;So definitely don&#39;t drink the whole thing?&quot; you say. 

&quot;No way mon!&quot; Eliza says over her shoulder. &quot;You see that first line on the dropper? That much. No more. Just a few drops; that way whatever effects you get will be over quickly. If you overdo it and end up stuck in this room as a twelve-foot-tall giant all night, that&#39;s YOUR problem.&quot; 

Your eyes get big for a second. &quot;Is that what one of these does?&quot; 

&quot;No. Just an example.&quot; Eliza snickers. &quot;Now hurry up and pick one. ONLY one.&quot; 

You look at the five bottles. They&#39;re each a different color and shape, helpfully enough. Which one do you go for? 

[[Lavender-&gt;Lav Potion]] 

[[Honey-&gt;Honey Potion]] 

[[Emerald-&gt;Emerald Potion]] 

[[Magenta-&gt;Magenta Potion]] 

[[Turquoise-&gt;Turq Potion]] </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="242" name="Lav Potion" tags="VW" position="2391,2036" size="100,100">You grab the lavender-colored potion, suck up a couple droplets into the dropper, and then put the little cork back in the bottle. &quot;Ok I picked one.&quot; 

&quot;Down the hatch then,&quot; Eliza says, still not looking. &quot;Let me know.&quot; 

You hesitate a moment, looking at the tiny amount of liquid in the dropper. It swirls like ink. Then you tip your head back, open wide, and squirt it in. Kinda tastes like... mango? Except spicy. 

&quot;Ok. So now what?&quot; you ask. 

Eliza turns back. She frowns. &quot;Hmm, now... which one did you-- ah ah ah, don&#39;t tell me, I&#39;m trying to guess before whatever happens, happens.&quot; 

You shiver. Your skin feels flushed, feverish. &quot;Hey, uh. If I had like a bad reaction to any of these, you&#39;d help me, right?&quot; 

&quot;Of course I would!&quot; Eliza says. &quot;You&#39;re agreein&#39; to be my test subject mon, I wouldn&#39;t leave you hangin&#39;. Only a stupid witch would treat her test subjects as disposable-- //oohhhh,// you picked //that// one.&quot; 

You flinch; your head&#39;s all achy and your back feels like it&#39;s throbbing. Fiery pulses race up and down your spine. You feel kinda horny... &quot;Uhh... which one?&quot; you manage to rasp out. WHOA your voice sounds... not necessarily deeper, but huskier? Kinda like how when you&#39;re recovering from being sick and some of your subscribers make comments about how you sound sexier when your voice gets all-- 

There&#39;s a nasty cracking sound and your head jerks involuntarily, and then your eyes roll back. You brace yourself against the table-- Eliza quickly clears away the potions so you don&#39;t accidentally knock anything down. 

You look down at your hands, your arms. Your skin has this weird sort of... gloss to it? But not from sweat, more like you&#39;ve been oiled up. Everything looks so smooth and flawless... you cringe as your head jerks again with more weird crackling sounds. 

&quot;Here, come look at yourself,&quot; Eliza says. She takes your hand and pulls you over to the corner of the room with a bed, a changing screen, a dresser, and a large mirror. &quot;Oh, and get your pants off QUICKLY.&quot; 

[[You stare at yourself in the mirror.-&gt;Lav Potion 2]] </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="243" name="Honey Potion" tags="VW" position="2531,1903" size="100,100">You grab the honey-colored potion, suck up a couple droplets into the dropper, and then put the little cork back in the bottle. &quot;Ok I picked one.&quot; 

&quot;Down the hatch then,&quot; Eliza says, still not looking. &quot;Let me know.&quot; 

You hesitate a moment, looking at the tiny amount of liquid in the dropper. It jiggles slightly, like cheesecake or whipped cream. Then you tip your head back, open wide, and squirt it in. Tastes like a honey bun, legit. Creamy and sweet. Almost... hmm. It&#39;s nice. 

&quot;Ok. So now what?&quot; you ask. 

Eliza turns back. She frowns. &quot;Hmm, now... which one did you--&quot; 

Before either of you can say another word, your stomach gives out a massive gurgling groan, and then immediately pounds upon pounds of FAT billow out from your belly. Your chest puffs up and your pectorals round out, your abdomen bloats up round and hefty, you can&#39;t even //speak,// it&#39;s happening so fast. Your eyes pop open wide as you stare down at yourself fattening up like a hog. Your feet disappear. You can feel all your clothes stretching to the limits. You can see your arms getting all thick and chunky, and your fingers all stubby-looking, your wrist bones fading, your knuckles all sunken in. 

&quot;THE FUCK??&quot; You say, laughing nervously. &quot;Holy shit, I&#39;m HUGE!!&quot; 

Eliza starts laughing. She sits down at the table. &quot;Ooops. That was the wrong one, I always get that one and that other one mixed up. Silly me.&quot; 

&quot;What was I SUPPOSED to pick?&quot; you say, trying to walk around. Fuck! You&#39;re so heavy, you just... sorta waddle like... ew! It&#39;s gross but it&#39;s also fuckin&#39; hilarious. At least it&#39;s only gonna last a few seconds, right? 

&quot;Well I thought, I THOUGHT I was puttin&#39; the one to make you glow like a light, but... they&#39;re both almost the same color and I guess I mistook it for... oh well.&quot; Eliza shakes her head at herself. &quot;I guess you&#39;re just a big chubby boy now, eh?&quot; 

&quot;Damn straight,&quot; you laugh. You lift your shirt up to your chest. &quot;Holy CRAP look at that. I bet I&#39;ve gained like two hundred pounds. Shit dude.&quot; 

You jiggle and bounce as you feel yourself. &quot;Wait, ok. Why would you even //make// a potion that makes someone get huge and fat like this?&quot; 

&quot;Because it&#39;s funny!&quot; Eliza scoffs. She waves a hand at you. &quot;Ehh. I remember the first time I ever slipped into a snack I brought for Beau. Watchin&#39; him plump up was hilarious; he got so ANGRY mon... really it&#39;s purely for prank purposes. It&#39;s not supposed to be permanent, so it&#39;s not like you&#39;d be fuckin&#39; someone&#39;s life up, but imagine April Fool&#39;s day mon! Imagine takin&#39; some treats into work for your birthday and lacin&#39; them all with a couple drops o&#39; this and watchin&#39; your coworkers puff up, yeah?&quot; 

You shudder. You already feel like... you might be shrinking back down again. Yep, yep, definitely. That didn&#39;t last long at all. You look down and watch as the fat sort of just... &#39;sucks back in,&#39; permanently. Almost as quickly as it appeared, it vanishes and you&#39;re left back at your normal weight. &quot;Sounds like a good way to get FIRED,&quot; you laugh. &quot;Ugh.&quot; 

[[&quot;Well. Anyway,&quot; Eliza shrugs.-&gt;Potion Test Stop VW]] </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="244" name="Emerald Potion" tags="VW" position="2381,1893" size="100,100">You grab the emerald-colored potion, suck up a couple droplets into the dropper, and then put the little cork back in the bottle. &quot;Ok I picked one.&quot; 

&quot;Down the hatch then,&quot; Eliza says, still not looking. &quot;Let me know.&quot; 

You hesitate a moment, looking at the tiny amount of liquid in the dropper. It jiggles slightly, almost gelatinous-looking. Then you tip your head back, open wide, and squirt it in. Kinda tastes like... hmm. Lime? Almost like a margarita, to be honest. 

&quot;Ok. So now what?&quot; you ask. 

Eliza turns back. She frowns. &quot;Hmm, now... which one did you-- ah ah ah, don&#39;t tell me, I&#39;m trying to guess before whatever happens, happens.&quot;

You start feeling really hungry, within the next few seconds. Your stomach growls loudly. 

&quot;Ohh fuck. That&#39;s the one you picked??&quot; Eliza starts laughing. &quot;Fantastic.&quot; 

&quot;Errgghh...&quot; you groan and double over. &quot;Hey uhh... this actually... this is starting to really hurt??? Fuck if I don&#39;t eat something--&quot; 

She sighs loudly and heads over to the corner of the room with a bed and a nightstand. She pulls a candy bar out of a drawer; you //rush// her and almost snatch it out of her hands. She puts a hand on your chest and gives you a little shove backwards. &quot;WAIT.&quot; 

&quot;Ohh c&#39;mon FUCK please...&quot; you beg. You&#39;ve never felt this hungry before. You&#39;re almost ready to bite //Eliza.// 

She peels the candy bar open and breaks off a small piece, passing it to you. &quot;We have to do this carefully.&quot; 

The piece of candy bar is gone. You barely even tasted it; you just put it to your mouth and... &quot;is that it?? Can I please have some more??&quot; 

&quot;Not yet!&quot; Eliza says. She points down at your clothes. &quot;I&#39;m gonna recommend you take off everything you&#39;re wearing. Clothes, personal items, all of it. Completely nude.&quot; 

&quot;... why, what&#39;s happening... to me...?&quot; your voice sounds like it&#39;s getting all, thick and husky, like... ugh. Almost phlegmy. Like you&#39;re catching a cold. You wanna sit down and just chill for a minute, but reluctantly you start to strip down. 

&quot;Well, you picked the green one. It can be a little overwhelming, so we&#39;re gonna keep you controlled,&quot; Eliza says. 

You&#39;re REALLY having a hard time staying upright. You feel like you just wanna lay down on your stomach and... eat. Everything. You toss your clothes onto her bed and turn away to look at the room. Maybe there&#39;s some things you can eat? 

You clutch your stomach, and look down. Your body almost looks distorted, like there&#39;s something wrong with your eyes. You look puffy and swollen almost... 

[[and your skin is turning green.-&gt;Em Potion 2]] 
 potion that turns you into a hungry slime boy; Eliza explains that someone else once took too much of this potion accidentally and couldn&#39;t control the hunger, becoming a big slime creature that roams the bayou and explainint the slime scenes</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="245" name="Magenta Potion" tags="VW" position="2192,1763" size="100,100">You grab the magenta-colored potion, suck up a couple droplets into the dropper, and then put the little cork back in the bottle. &quot;Ok I picked one.&quot; 

&quot;Down the hatch then,&quot; Eliza says, still not looking. &quot;Let me know.&quot; 

You hesitate a moment, looking at the tiny amount of liquid in the dropper. It looks kinda cloudy, like it&#39;s not mixed properly or something. Then you tip your head back, open wide, and squirt it in. It&#39;s rosy and sweet and... mmm, reminds you of peaches n&#39; cream, but also cake... 

&quot;Ok. So now what?&quot; you ask. 

Eliza turns back. She frowns. &quot;Hmm, now... which one did you-- ah ah ah, don&#39;t tell me, I&#39;m trying to guess before whatever happens, happens.&quot;

You giggle slightly. Everything&#39;s tingly, but it&#39;s centered in your lower abdomen... and then it goes lower. Mmff. Feels like something&#39;s vibrating down there. You shiver and shudder and can&#39;t keep the goofy smile from spreading across your face. Nnnnfffff that feels... 

&quot;Oh. That one. Of course.&quot; Eliza sighs and squats in front of a cupboard near the cabinet. She reaches in and you hear some clatters as she searches. &quot;Where&#39;d I put that ting...&quot; 

You just kinda stare at her ass and her shoulders and let your boner do what it wants. You twitch slightly. Mmff. Heheh. Fuck it feels like... fffffuck. You turn away from Eliza and undo your jeans so you can look at it-- 

Holy CRAP. Your dick springs up out of your boxers when you pull them open, and it&#39;s MUCH bigger than it&#39;s supposed to be. A deep longing in your gut makes you glance back at Eliza. Was she always so pretty? Hot damn, what if you just. Fucked the fucking FUCK outta her. Mmm. 

Aww man you have to touch it. You slide your pants down a little more and let that beast out... it&#39;s gained at least three inches in length and ffffFUCK the more you touch it, the more it grows... as your fingers close around it, you can feel your dick swelling up, engorging, ohh //shit// you can barely fit your hand around it and-- 

&quot;I suppose it&#39;s good you picked that one though,&quot; Eliza says, approaching you. &quot;Easy to deal with the consequences. I bet this one alone would make me some money from... mischievous folks, or just lonely old men.&quot; She&#39;s got something in her hands. 

[[It&#39;s a fleshlight of some sort.-&gt;Mag Potion 2]] </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="246" name="Lav Potion 2" tags="VW" position="2386,2161" size="100,100">You&#39;ve got... these little dark //horns// now, poking out above your eyes and curving up to point to the ceiling. Your eyes have inverted colors, with the whites turning black around your irises, and your pupils vaguely glowing an unearthly white like they&#39;re backlit. Your ears are pointed like an elf. 

You look slightly taller, slightly buffer, slightly //better// in every way. Your face and skin and overall complexion is just straight-up flawless like a model. You&#39;re sleek and sporty looking, and you... ohhh fuck your BACK... you scramble out of your shirt and double over as your back feels like it&#39;s splitting open-- 

You peek back at yourself. You have little bat-wings on your shoulderblades!! 

&quot;Quite the Halloween costume, hmm?&quot; Eliza says. She taps your shoulder. &quot;Pants! Quickly! If your tail rips &#39;em open I&#39;m not fixing them for ya mon!&quot; 

Your TAIL??!? You cringe and quickly undo your pants to slide them off. You&#39;re just in time; you feel the base of your spine and the small of your back tingle and crackle with intense heat, and then... 

&quot;AhhahahaHOWWW!&quot; FUCK it hurts!! But only for a second. You look down over your shoulder, panting, laughing just slightly. You&#39;ve got a devil tail! An absolute stereotype, with the arrow-shape at the end. You&#39;ve got full control over it as well, and can wave it around, curl it up, use it to point like a third arm... 

Speaking of third arms. 

&quot;Good. The potion works exactly as intended,&quot; Eliza says with a triumphant smirk as she stares at your crotch. 

You turn away slightly out of modesty. Your equipment&#39;s pretty much doubled in size and does NOT fit into your boxers. You reach down to feel it. &quot;... Wow.&quot; 

&quot;So. You picked my Incubus disguise potion,&quot; Eliza said. 

&quot;Incubus, huh?&quot; You check out your face in the mirror. It&#39;s a weird combination of somehow... prettier? Yet more masculine. And you&#39;ve got these little fangs now, like your canines have been upgraded another level. 

&quot;It&#39;s not a full transformation; ideally you&#39;d have clothes on to cover the missing features. Most incubus have some sort of tattoo or scar design on their bodies,&quot; Eliza says. &quot;And you obviously won&#39;t have the full powers of an incubus either. You should be able to levitate slightly though, and create small fires.&quot; 

&quot;... how?&quot; you ask. 

&quot;Just think about it!&quot; Eliza says. &quot;I don&#39;t know, I&#39;m not an incubus mon!&quot; 

Well, you&#39;ve got at least a few minutes of fun ahead of you... and hey, maybe you could [[record a little bit?-&gt;Lav Potion 3]] </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="247" name="Lav Potion 3" tags="VW" position="2388,2297" size="100,100">You don&#39;t have much time to play with yourself here, so you hold your hand out and open it like Spiderman. No flame. You imagine fire appearing, and just like that... you&#39;ve got a little fireball sitting in your palm. You can feel it&#39;s hot, but it doesn&#39;t burn you at all. 

Eliza reaches over with a candle and puts the wick into your fireball, lighting it. &quot;Mm. Cute.&quot; 

You close your hand. You&#39;re a... you&#39;re just really horny. You stare down at the tip of your hefty new pecker poking down the leg of your boxers. It keeps twitching, trying to stand up. You shiver and grin and let it rise to full mast, almost like you willed it turgid and full. 

&quot;You got anything I can fuck?&quot; you hear yourself say. It doesn&#39;t really sound like you, though. Sounds rough and wicked. You&#39;re floating slightly off the ground without even wanting to. 

Eliza stares at you for a moment. &quot;... no.&quot; 

You float a little closer. You&#39;re maybe an inch or two off the ground? You slowly drift her way, smirking, eyeing her. &quot;Wanna maybe... bend over?&quot; 

&quot;Absolutely not,&quot; she laughs. &quot;Good thing I only let you have a few drops of that.&quot; She&#39;s flushed; sweating slightly. She&#39;s horny for you, you can sense it. You can SMELL her... percolating... anticipating. 

You quickly pounce, gripping her shoulders and pinning her back on the table. The crystal ball lands on the floor with a loud THUD and rolls across the room. &quot;How would you like. To get //pregnant,//&quot; you growl in her ear. 

&quot;MMmMMM!!&quot; Eliza moans. &quot;You. You sit down! You&#39;re a BAD boy.&quot; 

&quot;Yes I... am...&quot; you slowly grind between her legs, up her midriff towards her breasts. &quot;And I&#39;m gonna FUCK you like a bad--&quot; 

you jerk back and cringe hard, as your entire body ZINGS and SHOCKS up and down. 

Eliza has a //taser// in her hand. She&#39;s smiling, but grimly, as she watches you recover instantly. It didn&#39;t even knock you down. 

You grin. &quot;I&#39;d have thought you&#39;d use a spell instead.&quot; 

&quot;This is quicker, mon,&quot; Eliza croons. She clicks the button and wags her hand at you. &quot;Just take a step back. You&#39;re lucky I know you&#39;re just being influenced by the instincts of the demon, otherwise I&#39;d be... completely neutralizin&#39; you right now.&quot; 

You jerk again, like she zapped you, but you&#39;re a few feet away. Your head flops sideways. You feel like you&#39;re being tickled harshly on all sides and you can&#39;t get away. Your little wings slip back inside and disappear. Your tail gets sucked back up like a noodle. 

Your transformation back into your original self is over quite quickly. Eliza sighs, rolling her eyes at you as you scramble for your clothes. &quot;Remind me to draw a barrier circle for the next person who drinks one of THOSE near me, mon.&quot; She tucks her taser away as she watches you revert. 

Soon you&#39;re back to normal, and are putting your clothes back on and trying to get rid of those residual horny feelings. You smile sheepishly at Eliza. &quot;Sorry &#39;bout that...&quot; 

&quot;It&#39;s ok. Frankly I&#39;m amazed you weren&#39;t trying to jump me as soon as you realized how big your junk was.&quot; Eliza waves you over to the cabinet. 

[[You carefully step closer.-&gt;Potion Test Stop VW]] </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="248" name="Potion Test Stop VW" tags="VW" position="2101,2440" size="100,100">&quot;So now that you&#39;re back to normal,&quot; Eliza says, &quot;why don&#39;t you have a seat and I&#39;ll tell you about the Wraith on this floor.&quot; 

&quot;The wraith. Is that like a Ringwraith?&quot; you ask. 

&quot;Nah, mon.&quot; Eliza rummages through her cabinet again. You hear little clinks and clacks as she moves potions around, searching for something. She turns back with an empty vial, and a large, cloudy white potion that shimmers as its contents swirl around inside. 

&quot;That looks like bottled cum,&quot; you say. 

&quot;It&#39;s not, but good guess,&quot; Eliza says. &quot;There are a few ways to repel the Wraith, but most of them involve you already knowin&#39; some magic, or crafting a special amulet, and I just don&#39;t have time to take ya on as a student mon. So this is how it&#39;s gonna be.&quot; She sticks her little dropper down the potion&#39;s neck and extracts a little bit, then squirts it into the empty vial and corks both bottles. 

&quot;So. Pay attention. You don&#39;t want to waste this,&quot; Eliza says-- she holds the vial over to you but does&#39;t give it to you yet. &quot;The Wraith is invisible, and you can&#39;t touch him. You can&#39;t punch him or kick him or hurt him. He will try to fuck you.&quot; 

&quot;... how can he fuck me if we can&#39;t touch?&quot; you ask with a snort of laughter. 

&quot;I said YOU can&#39;t touch HIM,&quot; Eliza shakes her head. &quot;But he can definitely touch you. And he don&#39;t care if you&#39;re a boy or girl. He wants to fuck. He died ashamed of his family and himself for failing to produce an heir to the estate and the family&#39;s fortunes. You can read some more about him in the library if you want; I&#39;ll not sit here and tell you the whole story mon.&quot; 

&quot;So... do I drink this to repel him?&quot; you ask as [[you gently take the vial from her.-&gt;IW Repel Exp]] </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="249" name="IW Repel Exp" tags="VW" position="1895,2798" size="100,100">&quot;Yah mon.&quot; Eliza&#39;s fingernails click on the table. &quot;But ONLY if you know he&#39;s in the room with you. Be alert and try to drink it before he gets too close. If you feel him touching you, you&#39;ve got maybe a second before he penetrates you. I would drink about half, that way you&#39;ve got two chances to ward him off.&quot; 

&quot;What&#39;s it do?&quot; you ask. 

&quot;Well... he wants to produce an heir,&quot; Eliza says.
 &quot;A son. Drinking that potion will fool him into thinking he can&#39;t accomplish that by fucking you.&quot; There&#39;s a bit of mischief twinkling in her eyes as she says that. 

&quot;Shouldn&#39;t the fact that I&#39;m also a male be enough to make him think that?&quot; you snicker. 

&quot;Unfortunately no. He just sees a living soul to mate with, not a gender.&quot; Eliza claps her hands together. 

You stare down at the vial in your hand. &quot;So how do I know when he&#39;s in the room with me and I should drink it?&quot; 

&quot;Well, he does speak,&quot; Eliza says. &quot;Sometimes. So you should listen for his whispers. And you should pay attention to the temperature in the room. It&#39;ll drop a little. Like someone turned the air conditioner on. And watch for anything to move that shouldn&#39;t move. Don&#39;t be afraid, just be alert and ready to take a tiny sip of that. 

Eliza crosses the room and unlocks a door in the corner. &quot;The library&#39;s through here... most books in there are safe to read, but judge them by their covers, I&#39;d say. You should be able to learn some information about the people who lived here, which will help you find some more ghosts for your video...&quot; 

&quot;Ok cool, thanks. It was nice to meet you Eliza,&quot; you say, and you reach out to shake her hand as she turns back to you. 

&quot;Likewise, mon... And try not to drink it all at once, yeah? Just in case you encounter him later.&quot; 

&quot;Will do,&quot; you say, as you [[enter the library-&gt;Library Enter]] </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="250" name="Em Potion 2" tags="VW" position="2535,2050" size="100,100">Eliza sits on her bed. She&#39;s got something in her hands that ISN&#39;T the candy bar. She better not be eating it, that&#39;s YOUR candy bar... 

no it&#39;s not, what?? 

You stagger away from the bed, and sink to your knees. Mmmm it feels good to just... relax. You feel so heavy despite feeling like your stomach has become a ravenous black hole. 

&quot;Stand back up and I&#39;ll give you another bite,&quot; Eliza says. 

Immediately you&#39;re on your feet. &quot;Fucking PLEASE FEED ME,&quot; you say. Your voice is... ugh. It&#39;s all deep and gurgly. You glance down at your hands; they look bigger, //fatter// than they&#39;re supposed to. 

Eliza tosses a piece of candy at you. You move much too slowly to catch it, but it hits you in the chest and

SINKS INTO YOUR BODY like you&#39;re not even a solid being... 

which you&#39;re not. You sigh, pleased to have some more food, and sort of just... melt down to your knees. Except they&#39;re not your knees anymore. You&#39;re turning into a puddle. Literally. You start to panic as you realize you don&#39;t have a proper SHAPE anymore, and slowly your body reforms and you get back up. 

Eliza grins at you. [[&quot;You&#39;re turnin&#39; into a slimy boy, mon.&quot;-&gt;Em Potion 3]] </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="251" name="Em Potion 3" tags="VW" position="2530,2178" size="100,100">&quot;A what??&quot; You ask. Your voice sounds normal again. 

&quot;Look at yourself.&quot; 

You hold your hands up. They&#39;re shaped like your hands are supposed to be, but you look like you&#39;re made of green fucking Jello or something! And DAMN are you hungry. You look around. You make slimy, sloppy noises when you move, like the sound of wet noodles being stirred or mayonnaise being scooped. &quot;Ok but what can I EAT though. You got more candy? You got any other food? Can I--&quot; 

&quot;Shh.&quot; Eliza is in front of you in seconds, her finger to your mouth. 
You lick it. 

&quot;There is a bit of danger to this transformation,&quot; Eliza says. &quot;It will only last a short while, but if you eat too much, not only will you prolong it... but you might make it permanent. You are a slime, now. As you eat more and more, you will //grow,// bigger, and BIGGER, and if you get too big, you&#39;ll get even hungrier. Until all you can think about is eating everything you can possibly eat.&quot; 

You realize you&#39;re sucking on her finger, and let go. &quot;Sorry.&quot; 

She shakes her hand. Droplets of green fall on the floor; you shuffle closer and reabsorb them up into your foot. &quot;The cool thing is mon, you can take whatever shapes you want as a slime-boy. You can be a cute little blob, you can be a square, you can stretch yourself tall or short or however much mass you have. But don&#39;t EAT anything else. I don&#39;t want you stuck as a slime like the last person.&quot; 

You shiver. &quot;Uhh. Last person?&quot; Without even realizing it, you&#39;ve sat down-- or at least, you feel like you&#39;ve sat down, but you look around and realize you&#39;ve shaped yourself into a plump little orb sitting peacefully on the ground. And you can see in every direction, all at once, which is a really weird thing to get used to, but super cool once you wrap your brain around it. It&#39;s a bit much though, so you shape little eyes into yourself so you can focus binocular-style, as your human brain is used to dealing with. 

&quot;Mmm. A partner of mine from college-- class partner for a history project. I invited her out here. Of course she got interested in my craft, but ignored my warnings to not just randomly drink things just because they looked tasty,&quot; Eliza says. She holds her hands out to you to show you the little stick figure she&#39;s made from some twigs and twine. 

You reach for it, and it lands on your soft gooey hand, sinking in slightly. &quot;Uhh... What do I do with it?&quot; 

Eliza smirks. [[&quot;Eat it.&quot;-&gt;Em Potion 4]] </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="252" name="Em Potion 4" tags="VW" position="2532,2311" size="100,100">&quot;Eat it??&quot; you scoff. &quot;How the... oh damn!&quot; you watch as the little stick figure simply sinks into your hand, and dissolves inside your gooey mass. 

&quot;Easy, no?&quot; Eliza reaches out to touch your head. &quot;Feeling better?&quot; 

&quot;I... I mean... kinda? I don&#39;t feel like I need to eat everything in sight...&quot; you say. It&#39;s true; the ravenous hunger has been instantly, but you imagine //temporarily//, relieved. &quot;So uhh... what happened last time?&quot; you ask. &quot;With the girl you mentioned.&quot; 

&quot;She roams the bayou now, looking for things to eat. She&#39;s a great big blob now.&quot; Eliza shrugs. &quot;What can you do?&quot; 

&quot;She&#39;s like stuck as a blob??&quot; you ask. 

&quot;She ate too much. Let the hunger get the better of her,&quot; Eliza says. &quot;Grew too large, put on too much mass, and couldn&#39;t turn back; her extra slime reabsorbed her human form as she started to turn back.&quot; 

&quot;... is there a way to save her?&quot; you ask. You feel like... well, it&#39;s a hard thing to describe, because no one else has any frame of reference for one&#39;s body being a semi-solid, reverting to a solid. But it&#39;s safe to say you feel like you might be returning to a more solid form once more. 

&quot;Possibly,&quot; Eliza shrugs. &quot;I&#39;d require much antidote material, and enough powerful sedative to render the slime inert while I captured her, fed her the cure, and got her to change back human while pulling her reverted form out and away from the goo. And I just can&#39;t be bothered right now; also it behooves me to have an extra monster haunting the swamps for now. Gives people one more reason to stay away.&quot; 

You stand up. You&#39;re human-shaped again, and feel much more stable, but you&#39;re still all green-and-gooey looking. &quot;Uhh. Ok. So like if I run into her, what do I do?&quot; 

&quot;Stay out of her!&quot; Eliza giggles. &quot;Hope she&#39;s fed recently and doesn&#39;t want some nice boy for dessert. If you&#39;re LUCKY she might just put some of her mass inside you in hopes of reproducing. She&#39;s probably horny as fuck, mon!&quot; 

&quot;Ew!&quot; You shiver and look down and watch yourself regain your original coloring and consistency. &quot;Well uh. That was... weird.&quot; Your thoughts feel all distorted yet; it&#39;s like your brain&#39;s still gooey or something. 

&quot;Ya mon... slime&#39;s not a thing to play around with. Anyway look, let&#39;s talk about what comes next,&quot; Eliza says. 

&quot;Yeah, you mentioned helping me out with... something?&quot; you say, shaking your head, and hitting your palm against the side of your skull. You feel some extra green goop trickle out your ear, but then your mind gathers itself again and [[you can think clearly.-&gt;Potion Test Stop VW]] </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="253" name="Mag Potion 2" tags="VW" position="2347,1766" size="100,100">She doesn&#39;t even have to ask you-- you turn and shove your schlong right into that hole. &quot;You know.

&quot;That&#39;s what this is for.&quot; Eliza runs her hand along the fleshlight now encasing your pecker, and then you realize it&#39;s... got like a hose and a valve setup or something, attached to the end? And... and what&#39;s that in her hand? 

&quot;C&#39;mon now, let&#39;s get this over with,&quot; she chuckles. &quot;Over to the bed. C&#39;mon.&quot; She leads you like she&#39;s got a leash around your neck. Except it&#39;s around your cock. One hand on your chest, gently enough, is all it takes to get you to lie back and SHEEZ you just realized how big your balls have swollen. You sit up for just a sec to stare at them. They&#39;re throbbing and bloating up like buns in an oven. They&#39;ve got to be the size of softballs by now. If not bigger. 

You whine as Eliza squeezes something on her end and the fleshlight actually SUCTIONS you deep inside. It feels so good it almost hurts. Holy shit, she&#39;s like... milking you! Like a cow or something! 

&quot;There we go. That&#39;s a good boy,&quot; Eliza says with a smug grin. You pant and grin back. Your head&#39;s lolling slightly. Your hips keep bucking up against the fleshlight-- you don&#39;t even need your hands to hold it there, or hers. It&#39;s suctioned onto you. It&#39;s like stuck there... 

And then you cum. And you nearly pass out. 

&quot;That&#39;s right mon, impregnate that bitch!&quot; Eliza cheers you on. &quot;C&#39;mon, let it all out!&quot; 

You just. You just lay there twitching in the most intense orgasm you think you&#39;ve ever had. You aren&#39;t just ejaculating, you&#39;re //blasting off.// You feel like you could destroy the gates of Constantinople with the sheer force you&#39;re putting out. 

Your vision goes all dark for a sec. You go limp. You take a sort of, micro-nap. When you come to, you look down immediately. 

&quot;Aww...&quot; you groan. Your equipment&#39;s back to normal. You were definitely digging the extra size. How long did it get eventually? A foot or more? Fuck, how big AROUND were you? You were like a horse there for a hot minute! You check yourself out with tender hands just to make sure everything feels ok. 

Eliza holds up a bottle filled with white. &quot;Look what you DID,&quot; she says in a mock accusatory voice. 

&quot;... did that come outta //me//?&quot; you ask. That fuckin&#39; bottle&#39;s got to be at least a liter. That&#39;s crazy. 

&quot;Fun time?&quot; Eliza asks. 

&quot;I... wow.&quot; You let your head lie back and try to recover. You feel exhausted, like most guys do after a good fap, but this was a motherfuckin&#39; KILLER fap. 

[[Now&#39;s not the time for sleeping though,-&gt;Potion Test Stop VW]] so you only let yourself rest for a minute or two before sitting back up and shaking yourself awake. </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="254" name="Turq Potion" tags="VW" position="2202,1875" size="100,100">You grab the turquoise-colored potion, suck up a couple droplets into the dropper, and then put the little cork back in the bottle. &quot;Ok I picked one.&quot; 

&quot;Down the hatch then,&quot; Eliza says, still not looking. &quot;Let me know.&quot; 

You hesitate a moment, looking at the tiny amount of liquid in the dropper. It swishes around airily, like it&#39;s barely there. It almost doesn&#39;t seem to be a liquid. Then you tip your head back, open wide, and squirt it in. Damn it&#39;s like a pixie stick or something. Sweet, but... powdery and weird. 

&quot;Ok. So now what?&quot; you ask. 

Eliza turns back. She frowns. &quot;Hmm, now... which one did you-- ah ah ah, don&#39;t tell me, I&#39;m trying to guess before whatever happens, happens.&quot;

You shudder, and then... stumble back slightly as your body jerks with a nervous-feeling twitch. &quot;Whoa, what-- whoa!!&quot; suddenly everything&#39;s bigger! 

//You&#39;re shrinking!!// 

&quot;Holy crap I&#39;m fuckin&#39;--&quot; you hold your hands up and look at them, then up at Eliza, who&#39;s suddenly much taller than you. Sheesh you feel like you&#39;re ten years old again! Your clothes hang off you all baggy and loose... And then you shiver and shake some more, and experience another anti-growth spurt as you lose another foot off your height. 

&quot;Don&#39;t worry, I gotcha,&quot; Eliza says, picking you up and setting you on the table like a midget. You shrink again in her hands. It&#39;s so fast; it takes over your whole body. You can&#39;t even... your brain can&#39;t //process// it. You squeak in terror as you realize how BIG her hands are all around you and how high you are off the ground... your clothes fall away in a pile like big hills of fabric below. 

&quot;OHH EMM GEEE YOU ARE SO CUTE,&quot; Eliza squeals loudly above you, her hands on either side of her face. &quot;Look how tiny!! I love little shrunk boys... One of these days I&#39;m gonna have to keep one of you as a pet.&quot; 

&quot;Uhh, nonono,&quot; you say quickly, waving your tiny hands at her. &quot;Let&#39;s not.&quot; You walk over to the crystal ball, which is now twice your height. You&#39;re like, maybe the side of one of the tarot cards? You pick one up and hoist it vertical. Yep, //exactly// card-sized. 

&quot;Here I wanna see you eat something while you&#39;re a tiny boy.&quot; Eliza rushes over to her mini-fridge in the corner, searching through it and the cupboard above it. &quot;Ohh here we go, here we go.&quot; She has a package in her hands, and she sits down at the table and pulls you close. 

She holds out a jelly bean to you. &quot;You like the red ones?&quot; 

You cringe for a second. It looks WAY too big. &quot;Uhh. Red&#39;s ok I guess...&quot; 

&quot;Ok open wide!&quot; she says, poking it into your mouth. 

&quot;Wait a sec--MMFFF&quot; 

You can&#39;t really fit it inside your mouth; it sticks out a good ways, but you bring your hands up to try to finish it. You chew as hard as you can. It&#39;s not easy. Jelly beans are gummy but also have that like, candy shell around them? You manage to down about half of it. Fuckin&#39; hell, you feel stuffed by the time you finish the other half. 

Eliza cups you in her hands and pokes at your stomach with a finger. &quot;You are. Absolutely. Adorable. I&#39;d totally keep you mon. If this were permanent.&quot; Her finger feels nice, rubbin&#39; your full gut... you just lean back and enjoy it. 

And then she puts you down as you start to grow back. &quot;Ok hey, get your naked ass off my table as soon as you&#39;re big enough.&quot; 

&quot;Ohh shit. Ok.&quot; You roll over and sit at the edge of the table, as you grow to about the size of a Barbie doll. You drop onto the chair below and shoot up another foot or so. 

Soon you&#39;re back in your clothes, feeling your body grow back and swell into them, until they fit you properly again. You smirk as your eyes go level with Eliza&#39;s, and then you&#39;re finally taller than her once more. As it should be. 

Eliza giggles. &quot;That was pretty hot, not gonna lie mon. Alright. Alright.&quot; She puts her hands up and claps them together. &quot;Let&#39;s... let&#39;s do something else. 

[[&quot;Sure, sure,&quot; you nod obediently.-&gt;Potion Test Stop VW]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="255" name="VW DrinkinGame" tags="VW" position="1635,2039" size="100,100">&quot;Mmm. You&#39;re awfully forward, aren&#39;t you,&quot; Eliza says with a raised eyebrow and a defensive look on her face. &quot;Well alright then. How &#39;bout we make a deal, mon.&quot; 

She heads over to her more homey-looking corner of the room, where you can see a bed, a nightstand, a mini-fridge, a dresser... She opens the fridge and pulls out two bottles of whiskey. You stare with interest. 

She plunks the bottles down on the table between you and her. &quot;You and me, we see who can outdrink the other,&quot; Eliza says with a smile. 

&quot;Only two bottles though?&quot; you ask. &quot;I mean those are kinda small... and I&#39;m a guy, and I&#39;m bigger than you. You sure?&quot; 

&quot;Don&#39;t be fooled!&quot; Eliza chuckles. &quot;I&#39;m hardly inexperienced. Plus,&quot; and she jerks her head over at the cabinet with all the potions. &quot;I got a few little treats to pour into each bottle, to amplify the effects. Accelerate the process. Neither of us will finish our bottle, I promise you that, before one of us wins.&quot; 

&quot;Huh. Ok. So...&quot; you pick up a bottle. &quot;If I win... you show me, ohh I dunno. Show me a cool spell. Something that&#39;ll help me find ghosts tonight, or fight them off if they turn hostile.&quot; 

&quot;Alright. Sounds fair.&quot; Eliza shrugs. She takes the bottle from you. &quot;And if I win... you gimme $50.&quot; 

&quot;... that&#39;s it?&quot; you ask. &quot;Shoot.&quot; 

&quot;Do we have a deal?&quot; Eliza asks. &quot;No hard feelings if you don&#39;t wanna, mon, I just thought it&#39;d be fun.&quot; 

Hmm. She sounds pretty confident. And SHE knows what&#39;s in her potions, and if she intends to spike some already-pretty-heavy liquor... How confident do you feel? 

[[&quot;You know what, nah. I&#39;ll pass. What&#39;d you wanna ask me next?&quot;-&gt;VW DrinkinGame Decline]] 

[[Slap $50 on the table. &quot;Let&#39;s do it.&quot;-&gt;VW DrinkinGame TF]] </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="256" name="VW DrinkinGame Decline" tags="VW" position="1758,2039" size="100,100">&quot;Ok, no problem,&quot; Eliza shrugs. She reaches up into a cabinet and pulls out a couple small glasses, then opens the bottle and pours you both a glass. &quot;We can drink without the contest if you like.&quot; 

&quot;Hey, sure,&quot; you say, and you down your glass within a few minutes. 

&quot;Alright. So. [[Next question-&gt;VW Q Fear]] for ya,&quot; Eliza says as she finishes her own drink. </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="257" name="VW DrinkinGame TF" tags="VW badend" position="1756,1899" size="100,100">&quot;Well let&#39;s go then,&quot; Eliza cheers. She takes both bottles over to her cabinet. You hear the clinks of a few bottles, the uncapping of the whiskey, and a trickle of some extra... whatever she&#39;s putting in that&#39;s apparently going to make this a very quick contest. 

She brings the bottles back with a couple small glasses, and pushes yours across the table to you. &quot;Alright mon. Same time. Same amount. You can give up whenever you want. If you finish the bottle you automatically win. If you fall over or pass out you lose.&quot; 

&quot;Sick. Let&#39;s fuckin&#39; do it.&quot; You pour yourself a shot, and she does the same, and you both clink glasses before downing the shot. 

FUCK

THATS 

STRONG

WOW

You blink a few times and make a face as you stare at your glass, then your bottle. Eliza giggles. &quot;I told you, mon.&quot; 

&quot;Fuck it, I can handle that,&quot; you say. You pour yourself another shot and she does the same. &quot;C&#39;mon, let&#39;s go.&quot; 

You both down another shot. Some drinks kick like a mule. This drink kicks like a 105mm smoothbore main battle tank cannon. You sit back in your chair, blinking hard and trying to get your eyes to realign. You belch. &quot;Wow, dude.&quot; 

&quot;You&#39;re tellin&#39; me, shunny-boy,&quot; Eliza says with a chuckle. Shit, she&#39;s already slurring her words? This... should be easy, right? &quot;C&#39;mon... lesh go again...&quot; 

Heheh. You both take another shot. And another. Bottle&#39;s gonna be gone soon. You grin stupidly at her-- Eliza&#39;s head is down on the table. She raises a finger and twirls it. &quot;I&#39;m still in... thisshh... *hic*&quot; 

&quot;Oh yeah?&quot; you chuckle. &quot;Well... let&#39;s finish...&quot; You pour yourself another shot. Throw it back. &quot;C&#39;mon Eliza... *burp* I&#39;m beating you...&quot; 

You lean back and stretch yourself out. You feel... well, drunk as fuck, but also like you need to just stand up and make sure everything works. So you do. You stand up, stumble a little, but catch yourself on the table behind you. You burp again and blink a few times and yawn, one of those big manly yawns that gets loud and fills the room and pisses everyone off. &quot;I&#39;ll wait for you to catch up,&quot; you say as you lean over the table. 

&quot;I&#39;m. Shtill in thissh...&quot; Eliza raises up and shakily pours herself another shot. She spills a few drops, but gets the shot down. 

&quot;Well...&quot; you eye your own bottle. You can definitely finish it, there&#39;s only about enough for another shot and a half? They weren&#39;t big bottles to begin with. You pick yours up and down the whole thing. &quot;Alright. **HICCUP** alright. I&#39;m done. I win.&quot; You groan and &#39;oof&#39; and let out a deep burp. 

&quot;Ugh, I always wondered... what would happen if I mixed... thossszhhh... together...&quot; Eliza looks up at you, appraisingly. &quot;Wait you&#39;re done??&quot; She stares at your bottle.

And she gets a funny smile on her face... &quot;good, good.&quot; 

Despite your intoxication, you suddenly feel a little alarmed.
[[&quot;... excuse me?-&gt;VW SquatchBeast TF]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="258" name="VW SquatchBeast TF" tags="badend VW" position="1754,1765" size="100,100">... Ohh shit. 

You hunch and double over hard for a sec, and then... lean back and tilt your head and emit a vast **BEEELLLCCHH** to the ceiling. Curiously, rather than easing the bubbly pressure in your stomach, you feel MORE bloated, and you rub your stomach and moan and then... then you look down. 

You //are// bloated. Like. Like fuck, dude. 
Like you drank about ten bottles rather than just one. Ok maybe not that many but **burp** oooff, fuck! You just got slightly bigger! You&#39;re fuckin&#39; ROUND now! 

You cringe and glance up at Eliza, who&#39;s got her phone out and is typing something. &quot;Don&#39;t mind me, I&#39;m just gonna watch.&quot; 

&quot;... WATCH?!&quot; you rasp out. Your midsection gurgles and you feel a full-body shudder run through you. &quot;Did you cheat or something??!&quot; 

&quot;Nonono! In fact I letcha win, mon!&quot; Eliza giggles. &quot;Just gonna see what my little concoction does to ya.&quot; 

&quot;Concoction? Wait did you... **burp** did you roofie me??&quot; Ohh fuck, you look fucking //pregnant// now. Your belly is tight and swollen like a sports ball. Your shirt doesn&#39;t cover it and your pants, holy fuck, you can&#39;t even reach down past them to undo your belt and it&#39;s like cutting in... 

You jerk back and look down and watch the entire thing deflate at once. Within two seconds you&#39;re back to your normal flat-ness. &quot;The fuck is going on... what did you...&quot; You can&#39;t think straight. You have too many questions and you&#39;re drunk, or, or are you even drunk? You actually feel more sober than not. It&#39;s like your body metabolized it all already or something. How though?! What the hell kinda potions did she... 

&quot;You didn&#39;t put them in YOUR bottle did you?&quot; you ask. 

&quot;Nope. I&#39;m happy with myself really. You though, I&#39;m hoping I did you a favor... yep, look now mon!&quot; Eliza points at you. &quot;Look at that shirt stretchin&#39; out.&quot; 

You&#39;re panting and your heart&#39;s pounding and you hunch over the table again and hear a loud **RIPPING** noise, and it feels like you took a deep breath but just kept inhaling and making your torso puff up with air... 

Except, wow. It&#39;s not air. When it&#39;s over you look down and see that you&#39;ve got some NICE big pecs now, much bigger than before... and your sleeves are all tight around your arms. You hold your arms out and look at them, at your hands. Everything&#39;s... growing?? 

&quot;What did you do to me??&quot; you ask. You feel a very weird mixture of elation at your sudden extra musclepower, but... also nervous, like anxiety... what if she&#39;s turning you into something?? 

&quot;I&#39;m showin&#39; you some REAL MAGIC, mon!&quot; Eliza cackles, just like a classic wicked witch. 

[[Uh-Oh. You&#39;re feeling all bloaty again...-&gt;VW SQB TF 1]] </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="259" name="VW SQB TF 1" tags="VW badend" position="1899,1769" size="100,100">&quot;Arrggghh what&#39;s... **BuuuUUUuUURRRRPP** happening... to me???&quot; you gasp and pant as you flop backwards, supporting yourself against the wall as you watch your belly swell back up again with whatever kinda potions are affecting you. 

Fuck, it&#39;s //heavy.// You reach down to clutch your bulging tummy, hanging in front of you like the well-earned beer gut of a middle-aged ex-jock. It doesn&#39;t feel gassy or lightweight this time, it feels... //real.// Like actually fat. You twitch and spasm left and right as more changes overtake you. Your face tingles and cracks and you shift your jaw back and forth to clear the achiness. You can feel your teeth getting sharper, like your canines are becoming fangs... 

&quot;Ohh. Now THAT&#39;s unexpected,&quot; Eliza says. 

&quot;WhAT DID you DOO TO ME...&quot; your voice is deepening with each breath you take. You fall forward onto your hands and knees and watch your arms thicken up with huge, beefy muscles... but you also see a whole lot of HAIR spreading down them, stopping at your hands, which are like three times bigger than they should be. 

Your belly hangs down and brushes the ground, a heavy sack below you, arching your back downwards until you feel your pants SPLIT open around your ass and legs as they, too, engorge with immense musclepower. Your shirt also gives out and splits into pieces that flop gently to the floor. You growl and grow and gain weight and try to stand, but... you feel so top heavy now, it&#39;s like why bother going bipedal when your arms are so nice and STRONG... 

You look around in fear. There&#39;s a mirror, a standing mirror in the corner, and you see yourself, and you look like a big husky beefy caveman or something, and... ohhh hell, your face, look at your face!! 

&quot;So what I did, mon,&quot; Eliza says, as she strides closer to you while furiously taking notes on her smartphone. 

You don&#39;t wait for her to finish, lurching close to her and rearnig up to full height. &quot;I&#39;m TURNING... INTO. A MONSTER.&quot; 

&quot;Yeah pretty much,&quot; Eliza shrugs. She holds a hand up and there&#39;s a golden-red glow between the two of you. &quot;You just hang back there, I&#39;ll tell you how it&#39;s gonna be.&quot; 

You barely listen; you can&#39;t stop looking at your transformation in the mirror. You&#39;re naked and covered with hair, all over, JUST like a stereotypical caveman, or... ohh fuck, like a gorilla! And you&#39;re still growing, and holy shit your face is like an APE. You&#39;ve got these big fangs where your canines should be, your brow&#39;s jutting out, everything&#39;s broad and framed with hair... 

You roar and hunch over once more. Your belly inflates utterly vast now, a great big firm storage tank for whatever you decide to put in it. Your body can barely carry it, so your legs become gigantic, as do your feet. And your arms. You. You can&#39;t. Wait. You can&#39;t talk. YOU CAN&#39;T TALK NOW. 

You just make these grunts and growls and huffs and snuffles... 

&quot;I was HOPING for another rougarou, but... a bigger one?&quot; Eliza says as she looks up at you. Her glowy spell seems to be keeping you held back away from her. &quot;But... looks like I got something better.&quot; 

[[You grunt and feel your shoulders and arms bulking up massively.-&gt;VW SQB TF 2]] </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="260" name="VW SQB TF 2" tags="VW badend" position="2036,1762" size="100,100">You rear up again. Your body is starting to fill the room with monstrous bulk. You can barely move without knocking things over-- Eliza puts her phone down on the crystal ball table and raises both hands, enveloping you in a magical dome glowing red-gold. &quot;Just relax, my pet. There&#39;s a good boy.&quot; 

Fuck, you&#39;re like. You&#39;ve got to be twelve feet tall when you stand up to full height. But you&#39;re built like an ape and it doesn&#39;t feel good to stand that high... You shudder and grow another inch. Everywhere. You can&#39;t see your junk but it&#39;s ready to impregnate the nearest hole, hard. 

Ugh, you feel so empty too. You&#39;re scared and angry and HUNGRY and HORNY... 

You blink and fuck it&#39;s like, you can //feel// your brain draining... fuck. You just. You wanna eat and fuck. You wanna smash something. You want to disappear. You&#39;re HUGE. You&#39;re covered in soft fur. You&#39;re... uggh, you&#39;re so FAT now... 

&quot;Like I said,&quot; Eliza says as she rubs her chin. &quot;I was HOPING for another Rougarou. But, rather than waiting for you to grow big and strong like Beau, I was TRYING to make things a little quicker... but looks like I created a new beast entirely. Hmm. What to do with you though? Can you even talk anymore? I don&#39;t think you can--&quot; 

You rear up and RROARRR and pound your chest and Eliza jumps back slightly, startled. You see the spell flicker... now&#39;s your chance!! 

What&#39;s first and foremost on your mind though?! What are you going to DO with your hulking new body??

[[ANGRY SMASH POUND-&gt;SQB AngryEnd]] 

[[RUN RUN RUN-&gt;SQB RunEnd]]

You pound the ground and advance on her. Boy are you PISSED. You&#39;re just reaching for her with one of your car-door-sized-hands when something SLAMS into you from the side. 

You roar and wheel to face the new target, which is getting to its feet-- it&#39;s a dirty big werewolf, dark and muscular and built like a brick shithouse. But YOU are MUCH LARGER... and heavier, and more solid, and the pounce did very little to you besides piss you off. 

&quot;The FUCK did you make in here nah, girl?&quot; Beau the werewolf says. 

&quot;Fight him off! Distract him while I figure out how to fix this!&quot; Eliza says. She gets to her feet and runs for her cabinet of potions. 

Beau faces you down with his teeth and claws bared. &quot;C&#39;mon nah smol fren. You ain&#39;t lookin&#39; so smol now, huh? What&#39;chu been eatin&#39;?&quot; But then he twitches and shudders just like you did, except instead of growing, he&#39;s //shrinking.// 

&quot;Fuck!&quot; Eliza says when she notices he&#39;s turning back. &quot;The spell!&quot; 

&quot;FUCK THAT SPELL,&quot; Beau yells back at her. &quot;Take that spell off now or I&#39;m goin&#39; back human again and--&quot; 

&quot;GRRRRR&quot; You lunge forwards and knock him down, then grab his ankles and tug him close. &quot;YYYYOOOUUU,&quot; you manage to rumble, though talking is pretty much out of the question for you at this point in your transformation. 

&quot;Hey nah what the fuck??&quot; Beau gasps. 

You open your mouth wide and engulf his werewolf feet; you can feel them turning back into human feet. Then you suck him in like a noodle, up to his waist. Ooo he almost doesn&#39;t fit, even in his human form Beau&#39;s got a big broad torso, but... mmf. You suck hard. 

&quot;FUCK NO!!&quot; he screams. But he slides in, and down, and disappears. Mmmm. Very tasty. Beefy. He fills you up good. You let out a huffing ape-laugh as you sit back and watch your belly bulge with Beau&#39;s mass. What a hearty meal. 

&quot;HEY now! You spit him the fuck out mon!!&quot; Eliza yells. She raises her hands and fires some spells at you. They bounce off your gut and explode into blue sparks. 

You giggle in your deep new monster voice and lumber over to her. Before she can react, you&#39;ve pinned her under your full belly and are leering down at her, grinding your fat Bigfoot dick between her legs. And she&#39;s staring up at you in terror and shame because she knows this is //her fault...// 

**END** 

You&#39;ve been transformed into a huge beast! You&#39;re hard to classify but you definitely fit the &#39;Sasquatch&#39; bill, but... 

well. 
Eliza&#39;s soon pregnant and immobile with your potent &#39;squatch seed, and you tend to keep her that way. She shouldn&#39;t have turned you into a monster without your consent, after all. But you DO enjoy being so large and huge and beefy and powerful. And covered with soft warm fur. Very nice. Sexy. 

Your belly eventually shrinks back to &quot;normal&quot; as you digest Beau and gain a few extra pounds of muscle and fat from his mass. He pops up as a ghost a few moments later and he and Eliza start arguing about how they&#39;re going to get out of this mess, but... you have no intention of letting them control you. You head out into the mansion, down the stairs, and outside. You&#39;re NOW free to explore the island and the swamp and nothing&#39;s gonna challenge you. Not with your massive new body. 

Little by little, your brain becomes more and more animal, and while you maintain a high level of intelligence, you start to forget who you once were. Just some dude, really. Kinda boring, right? Tiny and uninteresting. You&#39;re much better now. Bigger and FATTER and hairy and furry and ready to eat and fuck every waking second of every day. You roam the swamps doing... whatever, and whoever, you want. 

The locals soon craft a legend around you, based on a few eyewitness accounts: The SwampBeast of Bayou Lourde. Very very few people escape to tell the tale though. You&#39;re a big hungry boy, and while alligators are filling enough, it&#39;s fun to pick up a squirmy little scared human and gulp them down, feeling them occupy your great big belly, feeling their mass add to your own bulk and make you an even BIGGER monster. 

And if you&#39;re not hungry, you just fuck &#39;em and keep them around for awhile. While they swell up and give you babies. Much to your delight, you ARE able to impregnate either gender, as long as they&#39;re human. 
Soon the bayou is filled with little &#39;Squatches... and ghostly fishers and campers and explorers and search party members... </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="262" name="SQB RunEnd" tags="HS badend" position="2061,2032" size="100,100">Fuck this, you&#39;re getting outta here! Your massive weight shakes the whole house as you lumber over to the door. Eliza gets back to her feet and sends a spell your way, but it just... bounces off your back. You keep running. You don&#39;t even bother with the stairs, you just JUMP over the railing and land on the floor in the hallway

whoa

ok

You sit up. Where are you? It&#39;s so dark... You look around, then up. 

There&#39;s the house. It&#39;s... it&#39;s up above? There&#39;s a hole... did you fall through the floor?? You did! You&#39;re in the basement... 

//Wasn&#39;t there something down here??// 

You look around some more. Your eyes adjust quickly to the darkness, but you don&#39;t see any other creatures, no monsters... just a lot of spiderwebs. 

&quot;sscccrrreeeeeee.....&quot; says a voice below you. Well. A &#39;voice.&#39; 

You look. Flattened and twitching underneath you is a great big spider the size of a fucking horse. Mmf. Well. It&#39;s clearly not a threat. Somehow, at your size... you don&#39;t feel afraid. 

And you can&#39;t exactly fuck it, can you? Ew. 

But what if... of course. You //are// quite hungry. 

You roll to your feet and knuckles, lean in and sniff the broken spidery thing, and then scoop it up in your gigantic hands and stuff it down your throat. Mmm! Crispy. You just gulp the whole thing down, abdomen-first, and slurp the legs in like noodles. You grin as it lands in your big round ape-belly and swells you up even bigger. Your hands drum on your pleasantly full belly. It&#39;s so nice to have a big meal to eat and not be so ravenous... 

Suddenly there&#39;s a little &#39;crackle&#39; deep inside you. What was that? You rub your gut and have a seat for a moment. Hmm. You should digest this hearty meal before continuing on your escape route. 

There&#39;s a little &#39;pop&#39; 

and then a &#39;skitter&#39; 

and another

and another

ohh goodness... you&#39;re getting //fatter!// You&#39;re BLOATING! You groan loudly, and slowly tip backwards, as you watch your huge belly swell like an engorging tick. Ohh NO. What&#39;s it DOING to you?? You feel a whole lot of tingling and scuttling inside like... like there&#39;s more than just one spider in there... 

Ohh no, nonono! You can&#39;t move! You are flattened on your back under the weight and girth of your inflating abdomen, watching as little bumps roll all around under the layer of fat and fur covering your body, and you&#39;re just... you&#39;re //pregnant with spiders!!// How are they gonna come out?! So many spiders! You&#39;ve got to digest them all before they start making MORE spiders!! YOU HAVE A HUGE BELLY FULL OF SPIDERS HOLY CRAP!!

**END** 

... well... 

you&#39;re a big monster now? 
and you&#39;re trapped in the basement, a big furry ball with arms and legs and a head. Basically a big nest. A storage vessel for baby spiders. 

Not much to do now but wait... 

It takes awhile, but, you just sort of fall asleep and go dormant, and when you wake up some time later you can move again, but there&#39;s a whole bunch of spiders all around you. All over the walls, crawling up and down, spinning webs, crawling-- OUT OF YOUR BUTT, eww... they just crawl out like it&#39;s perfectly natural... ugh! 

You climb upstairs and leave them behind. Gross. Ew. You&#39;re never eating spiders again. 

Wait a minute! You&#39;re a BIG FUCKING MONSTER NOW!! What are you gonna do?? 

... hey. Whatever the fuck you WANT to do, hahaha! Who&#39;s gonna stop you?!? 

Little by little, your brain becomes more and more animal, and while you maintain a high level of intelligence, you start to forget who you once were. Just some dude, really. Kinda boring, right? Tiny and uninteresting. You&#39;re much better now. Bigger and FATTER and hairy and furry and ready to eat and fuck every waking second of every day. You roam the swamps doing... whatever, and whoever, you want. 

The locals soon craft a legend around you, based on a few eyewitness accounts: The SwampBeast of Bayou Lourde. Very very few people escape to tell the tale though. You&#39;re a big hungry boy, and while alligators are filling enough, it&#39;s fun to pick up a squirmy little scared human and gulp them down, feeling them occupy your great big belly, feeling their mass add to your own bulk and make you an even BIGGER monster. 

And if you&#39;re not hungry, you just fuck &#39;em and keep them around for awhile. While they swell up and give you babies. Much to your delight, you ARE able to impregnate either gender, as long as they&#39;re human. 
Soon the bayou is filled with little &#39;Squatches... and ghostly fishers and campers and explorers and search party members... </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="263" name="SQB FuckbeastEnd" tags="badend mult" position="1912,1908" size="100,100">You wanna FUCK
You wanna BREED
You need to IMPREGNATE

You lunge forwards and grasp Eliza tightly and she tries to cast another spell but you&#39;ve got her clamped firmly in your huge hands, and you flip her over and hook a finger in her pants. 

&quot;Ahh SHIT MON,&quot; she flails and scrabbles at her phone. &quot;BEAU, BEAU, PICK UP YOUR FUCKIN&#39; PHONE YOU MORON...&quot; 

You give her a shake as you rip her pants away and place her firmly below you. Your huge belly pins her down and you poke at her waiting pussy with the big monster dick you can&#39;t see but know exists because goodness is it ever eager to make BABIES. Big strong MONSTER babies. You grunt and wiggle your tip inside her. 

She pounds at your gut and squeals but quickly starts to moan in extreme delight. Her body flexes around you. You hear a male voice speaking through her phone. She turns her head to wail &quot;GET YOUR ASS UP HERE NOW, HE&#39;S FUCKIN&#39; ME MON!!&quot; 

Heheheh. You better do your job quick. You hold Eliza close to your body and push your way deep inside. She squeals and moans and her body twitches and her head lolls around. &quot;You... you dirty fuckin&#39; beast...&quot; 

Hey, she essentially roofied you. She kinda deserves this... hoisted by her own petard, so to speak. Not that you know what a petard is anymore. Fuck! Breeed! SEED!! You lean forwards, flattening her under your huge gut, and start to pump a mighty load into her cunt. Eliza laughs wildly. You can feel her cumming too, latching onto your fat schlong and cuddling it close. Yeah, she wants it. She can pretend like she doesn&#39;t all she wants, but. You can tell she likes it. 

You pull out. You take a few steps back. Heheh. She already looks pretty pregnant, to be honest. Her tummy&#39;s a nice round brown ball, and she&#39;s lazing on her side, clutching at herself, fingering her pussy... grinning up at you like you just made her day. &quot;You. FUckin&#39; prick.&quot; She giggles. &quot;Can&#39;t believe I just let you get me pregnant. Gonna have to PUNISH you for this...&quot; 

&quot;Eliza??&quot; you hear a loud voice yelling up the stairs, and rapid, heavy footsteps. You look over your huge furry shoulder to see another monster standing just outside the doorway-- a great big dark werewolf. &quot;Dammit Eliza you gotta take this spell of here nah, I can&#39;t come up in there or I&#39;ll turn back human... oh. Oh shit. He already gotcha, didn&#39;t he.&quot; 

&quot;You better run, Beau,&quot; Eliza says. She sighs and orgasms again with a little squeal, then pulls her hand out of her snatch and gives it a lick. 

The werewolf turns tail and bolts, but you give chase. You have a hard time fitting through the door, with your massive new body and enormous great-ape-gut, fuck you&#39;re like a fucking SASQUATCH you&#39;re just so big and heavy... 

The werewolf&#39;s just below you, running down the hall; you simply plunge right through the railing and smash it to bits as you fall directly on top of him and flatten him under your weight. Hey, being heavy and fat is kinda cool! 

&quot;UURRFFF. Hold on nah!&quot; Beau pants. Ooo he&#39;s a nice soft werewolf. So muscular and strong. And large. He&#39;ll hold MANY babies for you... 

**END** 

You have been turned into a MONSTER!! 

Your body is almost a ton of sheer muscle and fat and appetite. You&#39;re over twelve feet tall, and every time you cram your vast belly full of food, you seem to grow another few inches and pounds by the time you&#39;re done digesting. You&#39;ve turned into a huge Sasquatch-Yeti-Bigfoot beast, and you roam the swamp at will looking for food and fuckery. 

As is proper, you make sure Beau and Eliza are packed full of your cum whenever they get too close to you. Unfortunately you can&#39;t seem to impregnate Beau, though you try hard every time you catch him and he always waddles away with his own fur-covered belly approaching yours in diameter, absolutely stuffed with your spooge. 

Eliza though, is not so lucky, and soon there&#39;s little ape-like babies roaming the swamps with you. She THINKS she owns you now, but there&#39;s little she can do to control you. Her magic sort of... directs you, from time to time, but she makes no effort to attempt to turn you back human. Little by little, your brain becomes more and more animal, and while you maintain a high level of intelligence, you start to forget who you once were. Just some dude, really. Kinda boring, right? Tiny and uninteresting. You&#39;re much better now. Bigger and FATTER and hairy and furry and ready to eat and fuck every waking second of every day.

EAT. What&#39;s the use in having such a big, beautiful belly if there&#39;s NOTHING INSIDE IT?? 

You grab Eliza and she screams and you just pop her into your mouth and swallow. Just like that. Wow, you must&#39;ve turned into a REALLY big monster if you&#39;re capable of swallowing a person whole. Wow! You sit down and grin and chuckle in your deep, monster-voice. Oof. Your tummy feels plenty full now, nice and firm. 

&quot;LET MEH OUTTA HERE YA BIG FUCKER! I&#39;ll FUCK YOUR SHIT UP IN HERE, I SWEAR MON!!&quot; 

Mmmmm. You lean back against the wall, slumping down, and pat your tummy as you start to drift off. So BIG. Mmm. So round and full. What a nice big beast. How nice, to be so large. What were you ever thinking, being such a small human? This is much better. 

&quot;I&#39;M SERIOUS MON, DON&#39;T MAKE ME BLOW YA UP NOW!!&quot; Eliza continues to yell, muffled, as she pounds on your insides. You rest both hands on your gut in response and squeeze lightly. She moans. 

Mmm. Time to sleep this meal off. 

**LATER** 

You yawn and wake up and sit up and wow, you&#39;re still a huge monster. Look at that. And how &#39;bout that gut? Good morning world! Good morning! Hey, it&#39;s the morning. For real. You&#39;ve slept away the night, warm and happy in your new coat of fur. 

You roll forwards onto your knuckles and lumber over to that mirror. What a sexy beast. Covered in fur and massive muscles and so THICC. You grin at yourself. You&#39;ve got nice pointy ape fangs and a strong, stoic brow and pecs the size of a pair of sumo wrestlers jockeying for position on your massive chest. Mmf! What soft lovely fur. 

And a huge, beautiful //tank// for a gut. You don&#39;t hear Eliza moving around in there anymore. Your stomach has shrunk a little from digesting her, and the rest of you looks slightly larger by comparison... 

&quot;You UNGRATEFUL BASTARD,&quot; she says. In front of you. 

You look up. Oh. Oh look! She&#39;s a ghost now! She looks mad. 

&quot;I was tryin&#39; to make you STRONGER and you up and ATE me mon??&quot; 

You just huff some laughter her way and give your chest a quick pounding. 

&quot;I shouldn&#39;t have added that motherfuckin&#39; //himbo// potion in that mix, I bet you&#39;re dumb as a box o&#39; rocks now...&quot; Eliza&#39;s ghost folds her arms and pouts. &quot;Well now what the fuck I do? I can&#39;t exactly teach ya how to bring me back properly. Gonna have to get BEAU up in here and hope he doesn&#39;t FUCK IT UP too bad...&quot; 

Mmm. Beau? Mm. What if you ate him too? Ehh, you&#39;re not that hungry. Maybe you could FUCK him instead? 

Speak of the devil! Right on cue, you hear footsteps coming up stairs. You peer out the door and see a... whoa! A big werewolf coming down the hallway! Except he&#39;s shrinking, and turning back into a human, and... it&#39;s Beau, he&#39;s a werewolf. How &#39;bout THAT. 

&quot;Eliza listen, I couldn&#39;t find him all night-- hey what the FUCK??&quot; Beau says as he steps into the room. &quot;Did... what the fuck is... the HELL goin&#39; on in here?? Why you a ghost, Liza?&quot; 

&quot;Cuz the big fat BASTARD ATE ME mon, now get over here and get the sedatives so we can put him out and start fixin&#39; this mess--&quot; 

&quot;Ohh SHIT!&quot; Beau yelps as you quickly pound across the room and flatten him on the ground before he can do anything. Mmf. What a nice big muscular man. Tiny, compared to you, but he&#39;ll do. You don&#39;t waste time; you jerk his pants off and crack his legs open and STUFF yourself inside him. He yells out and thrashes to try and escape, and Eliza&#39;s yelling at you too, but... hey. You know what? This is their fault. They did this to you and now they&#39;re getting what they deserve. 

**END** 

You have turned into a huge BEAST! A Monster! 
A BRUTE. Hungry and horny and... semi-smart but mostly, a creature of instinct and vice. 

Having swallowed Eliza and therefore rendering her a ghost, you&#39;ve basically shut her down as far as any sort of control goes. All she can do is try to command you, which really doesn&#39;t work if you&#39;re not in the mood... and TRY to tell Beau what he should do, but he really can&#39;t do much if he&#39;s carrying a belly loaded with gallons of your cum, can he? 

Unfortunately you can&#39;t seem to impregnate him. Perhaps it&#39;s because he&#39;s a werewolf? Ahh well. It&#39;s an effective way to slow him down or even immobilize him if you can manage to fill him up enough. Even in his werewolf form, he can&#39;t overpower you. It amuses you to no end to watch his furry werewolf gut bloat up like a hairy ball full of your hot seed. 

And that&#39;s pretty much all she wrote. Little by little, your brain becomes more and more animal, and while you maintain a high level of intelligence, you start to forget who you once were. Just some dude, really. Kinda boring, right? Tiny and uninteresting. You&#39;re much better now. Bigger and FATTER and hairy and furry and ready to eat and fuck every waking second of every day. You roam the swamps doing... whatever, and whoever, you want.

Soon the bayou is filled with little &#39;Squatches... and ghostly fishers and campers and explorers and search party members... </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="265" name="VW Voodoo Doll Start" tags="VW" position="1782,2299" size="100,100">Eliza turns the doll over and wiggles her finger into a tiny seam on the doll&#39;s back. &quot;Gimme a hair. //Normally// you take a hair or some other piece of the person without them knowing, so you can fuck wit&#39;em without them knowin&#39; what&#39;s happenin&#39;? But hey.&quot; 

You reach up and run your fingers through your hair until you&#39;ve got a couple loose ones, and pass them to her. She pokes them into the doll, then cups it in her hands and puts her hands to her face. She&#39;s whispering something into her hands... 

You can sort of hear it in your ears, but you have no idea what she&#39;s saying. And then she opens her hands and wiggles the doll a little at you. &quot;There we go. Bound to you until your hair&#39;s removed.&quot; 

&quot;Sweet, uhh... so what...&quot; 

Eliza strokes the doll&#39;s belly and you jump back in your chair, giggling immediately. She&#39;s tickling you!! You slap the table. &quot;Holy shit!! That&#39;s... that&#39;s so weird, ahhahahah stop it!!&quot; 

Eliza laughs. &quot;You can do ALL type &#39;o stuff to a person wit one of these dolls. I bet it&#39;d be fun on the Internet, givin&#39; these to people and letting them film themselves messin&#39; with a friend... or enemy I suppose...&quot; 

&quot;Can I... hold it for a sec?&quot; 

&quot;Sure, sure. But you can&#39;t do much to yourself,&quot; Eliza says as she passes you the doll. &quot;Just be gentle with it.&quot; 

You hold it for a moment and look it over. It looks unchanged, but you can almost feel it like... beating? Like it&#39;s got a heart suddenly, or it&#39;s breathing, or just... it feels //alive// somehow. It&#39;s unnerving. You poke it in various spots. You feel some slight twinges here and there on your body, but otherwise she&#39;s right. You can&#39;t do much to yourself. 

&quot;... how do I know which is the front and which is the back?&quot; you say. 

&quot;Mmm. Gimme.&quot; She holds her hand out again and takes the doll, then strokes up and down. 

You lean forward on the table and go limp, and a blissed-out smile appears on your face as you receive an INCREDIBLE back massage. &quot;wwwooowww....&quot; 

&quot;Mmm. So sometimes if it helps, you can take a Sharpie marker and make a mark on the front or back.&quot; Eliza pulls out a ballpoint pen and scribbles a little dot on the doll&#39;s back. &quot;Or a pen I guess.&quot; 

You feel the pokes, but there&#39;s apparently nothing actually on your skin, because you stand up and hike your shirt up and turn to a standing mirror nearby. Your skin is bare. 

Your dick springs to attention. You look back and see Eliza stroking the doll&#39;s crotch. You blush and your voice cracks. &quot;Umm hey. Uhh. Are you... eheheheh.&quot; Your legs go weak. She is JERKIN&#39; you big time. 

You laugh and say: 

[[&quot;Ohh shit, yeah, that&#39;s awesome...&quot;-&gt;VW Voodoo Doll A]] 

[[&quot;Fuck yeah, give it to me... harder...&quot;-&gt;VW Voodoo Doll B]] </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="266" name="VW Voodoo Doll A" tags="VW" position="1632,2295" size="100,100">&quot;Mmmmfff...&quot; you fall to your knees. Eliza strokes. Caresses. You can just feel this... this huge presence, enveloping your body, like you can feel yourself being clutched in her hand, and there&#39;s her fingers, up and down... 

You fall. You collapse into a heap on the ground, thrusting up against the giant invisible hand. &quot;FFfuck!!!&quot; you whine. &quot;... hahahh... hahahaa... haahhhh...&quot; and you start to cum. You pant and whimper as you cream your jeans. Eliza smirks down at you as she lays the doll on the table to give you a break. 

Fuck. Fffuck. You just keep spurting. You scramble to tug your pants off and get your boxers down-- they&#39;re already SOILED but you manage to peel them away and send a few more jets sailing through the air to land on your chest and stomach. 

&quot;... you&#39;re a //mess,// down there. Aren&#39;t you,&quot; Eliza giggles. &quot;Fuck me, I love playin&#39; with goofy boys like yourself. You&#39;re almost too easy. Here.&quot; She tosses a box of tissues down to you. &quot;Pull yourself together mon.&quot; 

You lay there panting for awhile as you come down from the post-orgasm haze, then slowly sit back up and clean up your mess. Ooo you feel kinda... naughty. Just. Blasting off in front of her like that. At her touch. Mmf. It&#39;s like she... it&#39;s like she was putting you in your place. 

She DOES have pretty much full control over you with that doll... hopefully she&#39;s trustworthy &#39;cuz otherwise you BELONG to her now and... it might just be the hormones of cumming overriding your instincts but that doesn&#39;t sound like such a bad thing honestly. 

You pull your pants back up and sit back at the table, still panting, but mostly recovered. 

&quot;Once you can think straight again, I [[have another question for you,&quot;-&gt;VW Q Desire]] Eliza says, pushing the doll aside. </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="267" name="VW Voodoo Doll B" tags="VW" position="1769,2161" size="100,100">&quot;Oh you think you&#39;re in control here lil boy? Silly lil boy, hmm?&quot; Eliza chortles. She tickles the doll&#39;s belly, making you double over and flop sideways with laughter. She lays the doll down and splits its legs open, and you mimic its position like a needy whore and OHH FUCK there&#39;s SOMETHING in your ASS and you&#39;d be mad if it didn&#39;t feel so good!!! Fuck, you feel like you&#39;re being STUFFED... Why does that feel so good??? She&#39;s hitting... ohh fuck that&#39;s gotta be your prostate, holy shit... 

Eliza removes her finger from the doll&#39;s rear and gives you a second to catch your breath. You nearly came. &quot;Hmmmm,&quot; she says, rubbing her chin. &quot;I have an idea...&quot; 

&quot;Ohh shit shit shit,&quot; you giggle. You&#39;re just a quivering mess. You reach down to finish yourself off but Eliza grabs the doll&#39;s arms and pins them down, and just like that you can&#39;t move your own. 

She&#39;s got something in her other hand, what... is that?? It looks like a syringe or something!!

You roll sideways and try to stand up. &quot;Hey wait, what are you--&quot; 

Your eyes go big and crossed as you feel something //sliding into your bellybutton.// Eliza&#39;s inserting the syringe into a seam on the doll&#39;s belly, and ohh what&#39;s she doing, oh crap, crap... it&#39;s attached to a hose... 

&quot;I&#39;ve been wantin&#39; to try this on a cute boy for awhile,&quot; she giggles, and holds up the other end of the hose. It&#39;s. A bicycle pump. Why she has it you have no idea, but she starts to pump it, and you feel HUGE amounts of air and pressure blast into your body quite suddenly. The doll&#39;s little fabric belly inflates quickly and soon it&#39;s just a little ball with legs and a head, and... you cringe and realize that your own stomach is looking pretty round... 

&quot;Eliza??&quot; you squeak out. 

She just smiles at you and gives the doll&#39;s swollen figure a little gentle rub. It feels nice, but... ohh CRAP!! You feel everything go all stiff and your arms and legs push out as your body, your ENTIRE BODY, balloons in size almost instantly. You just. Oh fuck! You just SWELL! You get bigger, and bigger, and fatter! So round and tight... 

You wince as you open your eyes again-- you hadn&#39;t realized you&#39;d closed them. 

You can&#39;t see your feet. Your body, from your chest and shoulders all the way down to your pelvis, has //literally become a ball.// Tight and round like... ohh sheezz it&#39;s like a fucking cartoon... fuck! 

&quot;Want me to make you bigger?&quot; Eliza murmurs, her hand on the bicycle pump. 

&quot;Nonono please!!&quot; 

&quot;Bigger?&quot; She pushes the pump in slightly and you wail. 

&quot;Heheheheh.&quot; Eliza pulls the pump out of the doll and holds her finger on its belly where the nozzle was inserted. &quot;Look at you. My nice big balloony boy.&quot; 

And with her one finger keeping the air inside you, her other finger slides down the doll&#39;s belly to its crotch again... to its butt... 

There is a burst of arousal more intense than anything you&#39;ve felt before. You don&#39;t even know what happens. You just. You see Eliza squeeze the doll suddenly and... 

**LATER** 

Ohh fuck did you pop or something??!?

No wait. No. You sit up. You&#39;re... laying on the floor. 

Eliza&#39;s sitting next to you. Her hand&#39;s on your stomach, rubbing gently. &quot;Heheh. You ok mon?&quot; 

&quot;I&#39;m...&quot; you cringe as you look down at yourself. Thankfully you&#39;re mostly back to normal, though you still have a bit of a belly. It&#39;s going down steadily though. 

You wrinkle your nose. You can feel a cold, wet feeling downstairs. You must&#39;ve creamed yourself hard. 

Eliza stands up and heads for one of her cupboards. &quot;Here. I got some tissues, you can clean yourself up.&quot; 

A few minutes later you&#39;re back on your feet, wiping out your mess from your boxers, and feeling your belly deflate the rest of the way. You sit back down at the table, laughing a little. &quot;That was intense...&quot; 

&quot;Imagine doing that to a friend or roommate?&quot; Eliza giggles. &quot;Would you pay for it? Like I said, I&#39;m thinkin&#39; about sellin&#39; these little babies.&quot; 

&quot;I... can definitely think of people who would pay for something like this,&quot; you say, picking up your doll. 

&quot;If you wiggle the back seam open,&quot; Eliza says, &quot;there&#39;s a little pouch with your hair inside. Get your hair out and it&#39;ll deactivate, and then I&#39;ll ask you another question. 

You do as you&#39;re told and hand the doll back to her, [[waiting for her to speak again.-&gt;VW Q Desire]] </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="268" name="VW Q HimOffer Nope" tags="VW" position="1404,3005" size="100,100">You sigh. &quot;I... you know, I think I&#39;ll pass, for now.&quot; 

&quot;Aww. Well ok. Let me know if you change your mind...&quot; Eliza produces a potion from one of her pockets; it gleams with a silvery sheen in its tiny bottle. &quot;I been lookin&#39; for an excuse to use this on someone, but... maybe some other time.&quot; 

&quot;Hey, I mean.&quot; You shrug. &quot;I won&#39;t forget. I just wanna... I&#39;ve been doing good on my own so far. I want to see how far I can make it solo, I guess. And I just wanna finish tonight safely, with hopefully enough awesome ghost footage for a killer video.&quot; 

&quot;Well in that case, you might want to be aware of the //fucker// who haunts this floor,&quot; Eliza says. &quot;He&#39;ll ruin your night, and then some.&quot; 

[[&quot;Hmm? Tell me about him,&quot; you say.-&gt;IW Ghost Explanation]] </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="269" name="VW Q HimOffer YEP" tags="VW" position="1264,3005" size="100,100">&quot;... shoot. What have I got to lose? Tell me more!&quot; you say. 

&quot;Well.&quot; Eliza produces a vial of silvery-looking potion from her pocket. &quot;If you like. A shot of this will... hmm. It&#39;d be more fun to surprise you with the effects.&quot; 

&quot;Ohh, I see how it is,&quot; you chuckle. &quot;Tell me the secrets after I say yes, huh?&quot; 

&quot;Hey. If you don&#39;t wanna, no hard feelings. I understand it&#39;s a little suspicious, might sound a little too good to be true... 

&quot;And I know you&#39;ve got your own life, your own path to follow.&quot; Eliza sets the potion on the table. She smiles at you. &quot;I like you and I think we can work together, but I&#39;m not gonna go psycho on you if you refuse, mon.&quot; 

You stare at the potion. It&#39;s a tiny vial about the size of your pinky finger, with a flat bottom so it can stand. The potion inside swishes back and forth innocently enough before falling still. 

&quot;Huh.&quot; You carefully pick it up and eye it. 

... are you sure about this? Who knows what&#39;ll happen to you if you drink this potion? You can still back out if you want... but it DOES sound like a fun opportunity. She&#39;s kind of... hinting... like STRONGLY hinting, that her potions are going to, well. &quot;Enhance&quot; you. Somehow. Which really does sound exciting. 

It&#39;s all down to whether or not you trust her...

I just wanna have fun. I want an enjoyable, fun-filled life, low-stress, no bullshit...&quot; you shrug. &quot;Parties, good food, good drinks, and awesome people to hang with. A happy life I guess. No worries.&quot; 

&quot;Hmm. What would you say if I said I might be able to help you out with that?&quot; 

&quot;... what do you mean,&quot; you say, wary. 

&quot;Well... it&#39;d be a scratch-each-other&#39;s-backs situation,&quot; Eliza says as she swipes at her smartphone for a moment. &quot;You see, you&#39;ve got experience with travel and unfamiliar places, yeah? And let&#39;s face it, much more intelligence than Beau. My big loveable simpleton.&quot; 
She looks up at you, and for a moment she doesn&#39;t seem like a witch in a tanktop practicing voodoo deep in the swamp. She seems like a businesswoman. Even her accent sounds somewhat reduced. 

&quot;You want me to... travel for you?&quot; you ask. &quot;And what do I get out of it--&quot; 

&quot;I&#39;m getting to that, keep your shirt on for now,&quot; Eliza waves a hand at you. &quot;So I have a network of sources that have clued me onto some unique... shall we say, &#39;items.&#39; That I&#39;d like to procure. But I can&#39;t leave my post here,&quot; Eliza says. &quot;I&#39;d like you to get them for me. I&#39;ll be like your mission control, and send ya places-- often places where supernatural activity may be taking place, so that works out a plus for both of us. You get to look for ghosts for your show, but in secret, find the items I&#39;m looking for, and bring them back to me. And in exchange...&quot; 

She sits back in her chair and smirks. &quot;Well let&#39;s just say if you work for me, you&#39;ll have the most carefree life I tink a man can have.&quot; 

&quot;But you&#39;re not paying money?&quot; you ask. 

&quot;Right. Magic, not money.&quot; Eliza claps her hands in front of your face and for just a moment, your brain completely CLEARS of all stress, absolutely, blissfully, blank. Wonderful. No worries, only happiness and peace. &quot;You&#39;ll draw fun like a magnet, your subscriber count will probably skyrocket within the upcoming year... this I have forseen.&quot; 

&quot;Hmm... if I get more subscribers and views, I make more money...&quot; 

&quot;Exactly!&quot; Eliza nods with big eyes. &quot;See what I&#39;m sayin&#39;? I won&#39;t pay you money but I&#39;ll help you MAKE money... //Or,// if you&#39;d rather not, we can just forget I ever said anything. I can always fall back on Beau, I suppose.&quot; 

&quot;Huh.&quot; You prop your face against your hand and look around the room, pondering. 

Do you want to hear more?

They say money can&#39;t buy happiness but... it sure can buy everything and everybody else!&quot; 

&quot;Good point, good point,&quot; Eliza chuckles. &quot;Hmm. Well you know. I was gonna make you an offer... of employment. But the trouble is, I can&#39;t afford to pay you actual //money.//&quot; 

&quot;Oh yeah?&quot; You grin and lean forward on your knees, acting interested. &quot;What did you wanna pay me? And what&#39;s the job? Who do I gotta kill?&quot; 

&quot;Hush, silly boy.&quot; Eliza swipes at her smartphone for a moment. &quot;Here&#39;s the ting: you got experience with travel and unfamiliar places, and much more intelligence than Beau, who, let&#39;s face it, is quite the simple boy.&quot; She looks up at you, and for a moment she doesn&#39;t seem like a witch in a tanktop practicing voodoo deep in the swamp. She seems like a businesswoman. Even her accent sounds somewhat reduced.

And therefore... lots, and lots. Of money. And a fun job doing it, to boot. Or, if you&#39;d rather not, we can just forget I ever said anything. I can always fall back on Beau, I suppose.&quot;

I just... I guess I just want a lot of people to like me, hahaha...&quot; 

Eliza smiles widely, her mouth open to speak. &quot;Ohhhhohohohohoooo... then have I got a deal for YOU, mon.&quot; 

&quot;... yeah? What&#39;s up?&quot; 

&quot;I have a... proposal. A little, shall we say, job offer?

&quot;Huh. I like it... But no money, right?&quot; you say. 

&quot;Right. Magic, not money.&quot; Eliza grabs your wrist, and places your hand on the crystal ball. &quot;I don&#39;t know if you have the sight. But this could be the opportunity of a lifetime. I know it seems far-fetched, coming from a kooky girl in the middle of a swamp, but... just tink about it mon.&quot; 

&quot;Huh.&quot; You stare into the crystal ball, pondering. 

Do you want to hear more? 

[[Nah, this sounds shady. Back out.-&gt;VW Q HimOffer Nope]]

&quot;An eternally young wraith, tormented by his family&#39;s supposed failures,&quot; Eliza says. 

&quot;The wraith. Is that like a Ringwraith?&quot; you ask. 

&quot;Nah, mon.&quot; Eliza rummages through her cabinet again. You hear little clinks and clacks as she moves potions around, searching for something. She turns back with an empty vial, and a large, cloudy white potion that shimmers as its contents swirl around inside. 

&quot;That looks like bottled cum,&quot; you say. 

&quot;It&#39;s not, but good guess,&quot; Eliza says. &quot;There are a few ways to repel the Wraith, but most of them involve you already knowin&#39; some magic, or crafting a special amulet, and I just don&#39;t have time to take ya on as a student mon. So this is how it&#39;s gonna be.&quot; She sticks her little dropper down the potion&#39;s neck and extracts a little bit, then squirts it into the empty vial and corks both bottles. 

&quot;So. Pay attention. You don&#39;t want to waste this,&quot; Eliza says-- she holds the vial over to you but does&#39;t give it to you yet. &quot;The Wraith is invisible, and you can&#39;t touch him. You can&#39;t punch him or kick him or hurt him. He will try to fuck you.&quot; 

&quot;... how can he fuck me if we can&#39;t touch?&quot; you ask with a snort of laughter. 

&quot;I said YOU can&#39;t touch HIM,&quot; Eliza shakes her head. &quot;But he can definitely touch you. And he don&#39;t care if you&#39;re a boy or girl. He wants to fuck. He died ashamed of his family and himself for failing to produce an heir to the estate and the family&#39;s fortunes. You can read some more about him in the library if you want; I&#39;ll not sit here and tell you the whole story mon.&quot; 

&quot;So... do I drink this to repel him?&quot; you ask as [[you gently take the vial from her.-&gt;IW Repel Exp]] </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="274" name="VW Q HimOffer Done" tags="end VW" position="1109,2998" size="100,100">You uncork the bottle and pour it into your mouth. For a second you swish the liquid around; it&#39;s a weird mix of sweet and salty. Kinda bitter to swallow, as well. But it goes down. You put the little bottle back on the table, empty. 

&quot;Wonderful!&quot; Eliza says. &quot;Ok so. Let me just grab this... candle over here...&quot; she bustles over to her nightstand and picks up a classic-looking candle-holder with a long green candle sitting in it. She strikes a match and lights it. &quot;We&#39;re gonna go into the library. This is a special candle and will keep the ghost away from us. Do NOT blow it out.&quot; 

&quot;... ok? I won&#39;t?&quot; you chuckle. &quot;So uhh, what&#39;s that potion supposed to do to me?&quot; 

&quot;Ehh, you&#39;ll probably notice in a few minutes,&quot; Eliza shrugs. &quot;Come wit me big boy, I&#39;mma show you my life&#39;s work.&quot; 

Shit, you&#39;re getting somewhere with her now, aren&#39;t you?? You follow her to the corner of this room, where a locked door sits next to one of the windows. Eliza snaps her fingers at it, and it unlocks without a key. 

&quot;You gonna teach me to do that someday?&quot; You ask, half-joking. 

&quot;Ehh. Maybe.&quot; She shrugs. &quot;If I think you could use it.&quot; 

[[You follow her into a library.-&gt;VW HimOffer End]] </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="275" name="VW Q HimOffer Reject" tags="VW" position="1539,2997" size="100,100">You sigh. &quot;I... you know, I think I&#39;ll pass, for now.&quot; 

&quot;Aww. Well ok. Let me know if you change your mind...&quot; Eliza puts the potion away. For now, the offer&#39;s officially off the table. Literally, it seems. &quot;I been lookin&#39; for an excuse to use this on someone, but... maybe some other time.&quot; 

&quot;Hey, I mean.&quot; You shrug. &quot;I won&#39;t forget. I just wanna... I&#39;ve been doing good on my own so far. I want to see how far I can make it solo, I guess. And I just wanna finish tonight safely, with hopefully enough awesome ghost footage for a killer video.&quot; 

&quot;Well in that case, you might want to be aware of the //fucker// who haunts this floor,&quot; Eliza says. &quot;He&#39;ll ruin your night, and then some.&quot; 

[[&quot;Hmm? Tell me about him,&quot; you say.-&gt;IW Ghost Explanation]] </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="276" name="VW HimOffer End" tags="VW end" position="1166,3146" size="100,100">&quot;So, the next room over&#39;s my home and lab, sort of, but... this room is the place where all the knowledge GOES,&quot; Eliza says. &quot;Lots of books here containing the knowledge of the centuries. Some of them I&#39;ve even written myself.&quot; She places the candle on a desk, next to a closed laptop. &quot;Remember, don&#39;t let that candle go out.&quot; 

You shiver. &quot;So there&#39;s a ghost in here?&quot; 

&quot;You won&#39;t be able to film him, if he shows up. He&#39;s invisible,&quot; Eliza says. &quot;Ashamed of his life. He died young, and never produced a son to inherit this estate, and it went to a slave his father had fallen in love with. So he hides himself, and eternally attempts to... well. Produce an heir. But he won&#39;t come close to us as long as we&#39;re within the light of this candle.&quot; 

&quot;Does he try to like... fuck ya?&quot; you ask. You roll your shoulders. You feel energetic, like, you&#39;ve had a shot of adrenaline and are ready to fight or compete or something. 

&quot;Hmm... pretty much.&quot; 

&quot;Well bring him on, I&#39;ll fuck &#39;im up,&quot; you say, pounding a fist into your palm. Hell yeah. You feel strong. You feel ready. Confident. 

&quot;Ya can&#39;t hit him, mon,&quot; Eliza giggles. &quot;You can&#39;t even touch him... but he sure can touch you. But again. The candle keeps us safe.&quot; 

&quot;Well how do we know if he&#39;s... wait a second.&quot; You take a deep breath and blink a few times. &quot;Hey like... so are you gonna tell me how I should be feeling as a result of that potion??&quot; 

&quot;Nah. More fun to let you figure it out yourself.&quot; 

&quot;... I kinda wanna fuck,&quot; you admit. Shit, it&#39;s true. You&#39;re horny just thinking about the fact that there&#39;s a ghost who literally exists to grab people and fuck &#39;em. Not because the idea turns you on, but because you sort of dig the thought of being a-- wait, where were you going with this? 

You cover your mouth. &quot;Did I just say that?&quot; 

Eliza giggles. &quot;Silly boy. Hey c&#39;mere just a sec, I wanna...&quot; she turns to you and pushes you sideways so you spin around. And then her hands slide up your body from behind. &quot;Mmmm I wanna feel.&quot; 

&quot;... oh yeah?&quot; you say. Normally you&#39;d probably be a little irritated or even offended that she just decides to cop a feel like, excuse me? But hot damn. That feels good. You get even hornier. When the FUCK did arousal become a factor here? Must be that potion. Mmmfff. You cock your head back and forth, and roll your shoulders, and flex up a bit to let her feel your pecs. 

&quot;Mmmmm yes, yes... //grooowww for me,//&quot; Eliza croons up at you, murmuring in your ear. &quot;You want to be a big. strong. hunk. Yes you do.&quot; 

You&#39;re too horny to disagree. You grunt and inhale deeply and turn around to look down at her. WAY down... she was shorter than you before, but now she&#39;s at least a whole HEAD shorter than you. 

Heheheh. She must be shrinking. Tiny little girl. Cute lil&#39; lady. You could pick her up easy &#39;cuz you&#39;re a big strong guy. You smirk and flex one of your arms for her to show her your great big biceps. &quot;How &#39;bout that, huh?&quot; you say in a smooth voice. Oof! A fantastic voice! A SEXY voice. A bedroom voice. You hook Eliza&#39;s waist and pull her close. 

&quot;Hmmhmm,&quot; she chuckles, reaching up to push you away, but you really just care about her hands on your big broad chest. Hey wait a second-- when //did// you get a big broad chest? You look down at the way your shirt&#39;s gotten all tight and stretchy and you&#39;ve just... whoa! CHeck THAT out!! You&#39;ve actually got //big// pecs now! When did that happen?? 

&quot;I think you&#39;re gonna like being my big hunky jock slave,&quot; Eliza cooes as she slides her hands down your sides and feels your beefy ass. &quot;Mm. You&#39;re filling out nicely. Big boy. Nice big boy. Soon you&#39;ll be as big as //Beau.// Maybe even bigger.&quot; 

Is that... is that true? You were not... a while ago? Your memory&#39;s a little odd. You came here to ask her for help, right? No wait, you came here to film videos. Videos! You should take a selfie for the video! Yeah! 

You pull your phone out and slide a hand through your hair a couple times, then get some shots if yourself. Mmm. Yeah. Yeah bitch. Hella sexy. Look at those guns! Shirt barely even FITS around your bulk. 

... but when did you... get so buff??? Shit dude you look down and you&#39;ve just got... big PECS and you can barely even see your toes and it&#39;s like... fuck... it&#39;s kinda hot??

&quot;So for your first assignment, my big sexy beefcake...&quot; and Eliza&#39;s flattery ensures she has your full attention, and you loom over her protectively with your big body, like a proper henchman should. After all, as long as she&#39;s safe and protected, you get to stay big and THICC and brawny-- 

Wait wait, wait, wait! Wasn&#39;t there... you... no wait, this... isn&#39;t what you were here for... 

Ahh, whatever. Fuck it. 

**END** 

You have been bulked up into a big hunky STUD. 

Unfortunately you&#39;ve had to trade some brains for brawn in the process. Oh well. You were doing fine before anyway, and Eliza&#39;s like WAY smarter than you need to be, so. She can handle the good shit. 

Your body swells up with nice big muscles, and true to her words, you&#39;re close to, if not //bigger,// than Beau, though he&#39;s still heavier. You&#39;ve got a nice lean core compared to Beau&#39;s country-fried thickness. If you were still halfway decent at math, you&#39;d probably estimate you&#39;ve TRIPLED in size and weight and overall bulk, but... who needs to be good at math when everyone&#39;s smartphone has a calculator these days? 

Fuck, you can just... lift a TON of shit now. It&#39;s awesome. You can move shit, you can open shit, you can BREAK shit... and no matter where you go, or what videos you film, people. Look. At. You. People gaze at you longingly, jealously, lustfully... 

And you look great, you really do. Form, AND Function. Aesthetically pleasing but hot damn if anyone ever steps to you, you&#39;ll be able to lay &#39;em out within one or two good punches. 

Eliza, true to her word, sends you globe-trotting. Your channel and Internet presence doesn&#39;t quite shift focus away from ghost-hunting, but subscribers note the differences and seem to like them, in both your physique and personality. Some people question it, but most of them accept your joking &quot;oh yeah I met a witch doctor and she made me bulk up&quot; explanation... even though it&#39;s pretty much the truth. Others make some teasing or even snide little comments about how you seem kinda... dumber, since the change, like a typical jock meathead, but... it&#39;s like bitch STFU and bend over? 

But yeah, you just... you go places now. All over. You explore ruins and secret hiding places, abandoned facilities... you go //adventuring,// and it&#39;s a fuckton of fun, and you actually get a lot more famous from it, and soon you&#39;re raking in the cash from the Internet, people love you, and... you&#39;re invited places. And you&#39;re invited by people. You&#39;re propositioned. You are //IN-DEMAND.// 

You fuck. You fuck. You fuck. You fuck. You fuck everything and everyone. You MOUNT people. You CLAIM people. You enter a room, and decide who&#39;s getting fucked that night, and that&#39;s just it. It happens. You just kinda gaze at someone for a few seconds and as soon as they look back, it&#39;s almost like they know they&#39;re getting //impregnated// sooner or later. 

Of course. You //do// have to return to Eliza frequently in order to get more doses of potion to keep you beefy and sexy... among other endowments like giving you the stamina to fuck for DAYS without stopping if you don&#39;t want to, or teaching you some small spells that you&#39;re capable of understanding... but she always lets you know that whenever you want it all to stop, you can just say the word and return to normal. 

So yeah, you can quit any time, but... why would you want to, dude?? You&#39;re having too much fun! </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="277" name="Library Enter" tags="LIB" position="2028,2799" size="100,100">The door shuts behind you, and you hear it lock immediately. You look around the room. A few soft candles glow here and there, providing just enough light for you to not stumble around. 

It&#39;s definitely a library. Very classic-looking. Tons of dusty books in fancy wooden shelves. You&#39;re absolutely sure you don&#39;t want to spend all night in here reading randomly, so... you&#39;ll have to browse a bit. 

You keep your eyes and ears open for any signs of that ghost entering the room, and spend a little time exploring the place. It&#39;s not really //big,// roughly the size of an extra-large bedroom, and the main set of bookshelves is laid out along the far wall. Another set of shelves is free-standing, lengthwise. From above you can tell the setup would look like a capital letter &quot;E,&quot; with the middle stroke of the letter detatched to allow for a large window and doorframe that leads onto a balcony outside. 

There&#39;s some smaller shelves here and there throughout the room-- newer, like store-bought kits that someone put together rather than the fancier, sturdier, older shelves at the back of the room. And a desk with more stacks of books, notebooks, modern office supplies, a working lamp... and even a laptop. 

You sit down in the swivel chair and peer over her various notes, trying to touch as little as possible. Hmm... you know, she didn&#39;t want anything to do with being filmed or photographed, but now that she&#39;s not in the room, you&#39;re free to pull your phone out and maybe vlog a little bit more. 

You //do// want to read a little, as well, but there&#39;s way too many books to choose from. Perhaps Eliza has made some notes of the best ones, or has some sort of organizational system you can inspect to help you get started? 

[[Film a vlog scene.-&gt;LibraryVlog A]] 

[[Take a closer look at Eliza&#39;s notes.-&gt;LibraryDesk Init]] </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="278" name="LibraryVlog A" tags="LIB IW" position="2023,2928" size="100,100">&quot;So, you guys,&quot; you say. &quot;I have got a //story// for you: so there&#39;s... ok I couldn&#39;t film her, she didn&#39;t want to be filmed, BUT! There&#39;s like a real-life witch mixing potions up in here! She gave me this,&quot; and you pull out the potion Eliza gave you and hold it up to your phone&#39;s camera. &quot;Apparently, there&#39;s an invisible ghost that haunts this floor, and this potion is supposed to make him leave me alone. 

&quot;So anyway. I&#39;m in the house&#39;s library, upstairs,&quot; you say, and you slowly walk away from the desk. &quot;I&#39;m gonna try to find some books that talk about this place and the people who lived here.&quot; You almost say Eliza&#39;s name, but catch yourself just in time. &quot;The witch told me she&#39;s got books in here that should help me learn about the various ghosts haunting this place. Cool shit.&quot; 

You walk your phone around the room slowly as you speak, getting some long shots of the library. You stop in front of a big painting on the wall opposite the door you came in. &quot;Like, this guy, look!&quot; you say, and aim your phone. The painting is one of those old classic &#39;rich person commissions fanciful portrait of themselves&#39; in an ornate frame that looks too heavy to be hanging up there in the first place. 

&quot;Looks like he&#39;s wearing a Confederate uniform-- I guess that&#39;s to be expected,&quot; you say. The man in the painting looks, well... young? But it&#39;s hard to determine his age. He&#39;s very handsome though, and fills his uniform out well. He looks fresh and ready to fight-- likely from a position of privilege, if he was rich enough to have a big painting like this commissioned... 

//The man looks down at you.// 

&quot;FUCK,&quot; you jump back, nearly stumbling on a rug. You keep your phone centered on the painting. It looks completely normal, but you SWEAR it moved for a second like a Harry Potter painting. 

The room just got colder. And it&#39;s not just you. You back away carefully; you can&#39;t afford to drop that potion! &quot;Uhh, guys, I might have pissed him off. Uh. It&#39;s a very good picture of you, sir. I was just admiring the, uhh, craftsmanship? Heheh.&quot; 

You don&#39;t see any ghosts. Of course he&#39;s supposed to be invisible... 

A blast of freezing cold hits you in the face and you fall backwards. 

&gt;&gt;&quot;bbbbbbbBBBBBENNNNNDDD.....&quot;&lt;&lt; an ethereal whisper passes through the air. It starts quietly and ends just as quietly, like you&#39;re only hearing a part of what the wraith is saying. Fuck, if you could just see him!! 

The potion&#39;s still clutched in your hand. You set your phone down beside you and prop yourself up on your elbows to open it and... 

Freezing cold hands touch your knees, grasp your legs. &gt;&gt;&quot;aaaaaaaaiiiirrrrr...&lt;&lt; ............ &#39;air&#39;? Did he just say &#39;air&#39;? Or... no, oh fuck he probably meant HEIR(s)... 

There&#39;s only one thing to do, with the invisible wraith actually close enough to touch you. As you feel the hands grip your legs and pull them apart with undead strength, you [[pop the vial open and drink the contents...-&gt;Lib IW FuckRepel]] well, half of the potion anyway... </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="279" name="LibraryDesk Init" tags="IW LIB" position="2166,2797" size="100,100">Ok yeah, no. You can vlog any time. Better to get some information first than to just vlog for the sake of vlogging. You leaf through Eliza&#39;s notes as carefully as you can; you do your best not to let anything get out of order. There&#39;s a LOT of information on magical theories and artifacts here... maybe she wasn&#39;t kidding about that little job offer she mentioned? Wow, like... that would be a whole &#39;nuther life for you: traveling to India and Japan and Norway and Scotland and Mexico and all these other places, searching for supernatural anomalies and items... 

But you&#39;re just a bit suspicious of the fact that you&#39;d HAVE to drink a potion of hers before agreeing to work with her. Almost sounds like, once she&#39;s got you in her grasp, she doesn&#39;t want to let you go. 

Maybe she&#39;s got like... a book list in here you can look through? Some notes, references, a bibliography... anything. A place to start, really. 

It&#39;s kinda cold in here though. Wasn&#39;t that a sign? 

Ohh shit. You hear someone whispering, over by that painting on the wall. Barely ten feet from you... &gt;&gt;//Hhhhhhhhaaaaaaaaaaarrrrrrrrr//&lt;&lt; it sounds like. Or maybe they were saying &quot;air.&quot; Your heart starts pounding quick. Instinctively you look around, but smack your forehead. The fucker&#39;s INVISIBLE, duh. 

Well... you stand up. Time to face the Wraith. You&#39;ve got Eliza&#39;s little potion clutched firmly in your right hand. You&#39;ve got no idea how fast the Wraith moves, and you&#39;re not taking any chances. You uncap the potion and eye it carefully before throwing back about half, swallowing... 

&quot;Yoooouuu muuusstt.... bbeeearrr...&quot; the ghostly whisper seems too quiet to fill the room the way it does. 

You cap the potion and tuck it carefully back in your pocket, then brace yourself for the ghost&#39;s approach. You can just barely see some dust being stirred up on the hardwood flooring, coming closer, like footsteps. 

[[&quot;A SONnnnnn...&quot;-&gt;Lib IW DrinkQuick]] </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="280" name="Lib IW FuckRepel" tags="LIB IW" position="2172,2931" size="100,100">You almost drink the whole potion, but you remember at the last second that you&#39;re supposed to save some of it just in case. You&#39;re a little hopped up on adrenaline though-- there&#39;s an ACTUAL ghost touching you! And shit are his hands clammy-cold. And... 

and oh crap he&#39;s like. he&#39;s got you on your back and spreading your legs open like... uhh fuck no!! 

You quickly cap the vial and clutch it tight in your hand as you backpedal away from the ghost-- except, he comes WITH you, and now you can feel his body on top of you, his chilly breaths hitting your face... he&#39;s //mounting// you! You let out a little whimper of terror. &quot;Hey, look Mr. Ghost dude, uhh. I can&#39;t actually... I&#39;m a guy?? Like you?? So I can&#39;t make any OHH FUCK FUCK FUCK!!&quot; 

He&#39;s //fucking// you!! Oh no!! 
You flop backwards as your asshole opens up, seemingly on its own, around a shaft that doesn&#39;t seem to actually exist. He didn&#39;t even take your clothes off, your jeans are still on but he&#39;s InSIDE YOU, crap!! 

&gt;&gt;&quot;SSSSssssssoOoonnnnnn...&quot; Son?? SON?! Did he just call you SON?? You feebly try to pull away from him but he&#39;s... he&#39;s got actual WEIGHT, and from what you can tell and feel of his invisible presence, he&#39;s a rather sturdy man... broad-chested and strong... and you can&#39;t move! You just sort of squirm backwards, and he simply comes with you, keeping you pinned beneath him and spread wide as he thrusts inside... 

Quite suddenly your lower tummy emits a loud gurgling, bubbling sound. You arch your back as the ghost stuffs his dick in further, and then you look down and see your stomach puff up full and round. 

You freeze. The ghost freezes. You can&#39;t see him, but you can imagine he&#39;s looking down at your gut, just like you are. 

And then you get //bigger.// Your cheeks puff out; it feels like someone&#39;s inserted an air compressor hose into your belly and turned it on full blast. Your abdomen bulges up LARGE and ROUND and tight like a drum. If life were a cartoon, you&#39;d be making rubbery, balloony, stretchy noises. Your belly inflates into a great big pregnant-looking ball. 

You prop yourself up on your elbows as you feel those cold hands splay across the surface of your bare skin. Your shirt is pushed up to your pecs, and the hands feel all over your swollen belly... 

&quot;CUCKOLDRY!!&quot; the ghost hisses. &quot;BEDEVILMENT!! TARNATION DAMN!!&quot; His voice sounds like it&#39;s been wrapped in rusty chains for too long. The house creaks ominously, as though it can feel his displeasure. 

You put on a pouting look as you stare in the general direction where you think the ghost&#39;s face is. &quot;I&#39;m, um. Already pregnant? See? See my... my belly?&quot; You ham it up a bit and flex your abs, making it feel like you&#39;ve got something kicking inside. &quot;Ohh my um, my son is kicking...&quot; 

Finally you feel that invisible wang slide out of you and your asshole can close up. You hear a faint sob of despair, somewhere in the far corner of the room, by that big painting on the wall. &quot;nooo heeiirrss...&quot; the voice rasps before fading away. 

[[You take a moment to recover.-&gt;Lib IW FuckRecover]] </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="281" name="Lib IW FuckRecover" tags="LIB" position="2328,2936" size="100,100">You flop back, panting a bit, but relieved that the ghost is gone. 

Shit. You almost had GHOST CUM inside you. What would //that// have been like? Ugh! 

After taking a few moments to recuperate, you calm yourself down and sit up and look down at your perfectly round new globe, sitting in your lap where there should be nothing but air. You touch it. It&#39;s quite tight and firm; your shirt covers it about halfway, but you look like someone forced you to swallow a basketball or something. 

You frown. When Eliza said it would fool the ghost, you were kinda thinking like... it would give you an illusionary gut or make you appear to him as a pregnant woman or something? But that it&#39;d be all fake and smoke &#39;n mirrors... you didn&#39;t actually think you&#39;d bloat up for REAL. 

You stand up and try walking a few steps. Ok. Ok. This is manageable at least. It&#39;s just like having a pillow shoved in your shirt, except it&#39;s real. Mm. Kinda cold underneath. You rub your bare skin and hope the temperature will rise back up a little now that the ghost is gone. 

&quot;... ok. So um.&quot; You aim your phone down at yourself, get a few different angles. &quot;Uhh. You guys see that? I&#39;m a little, uhh. Embarrassed. Didn&#39;t wanna show y&#39;all. But. The ghost in this room apparently wants to make people pregnant. So... the potion I drank to ward him off, makes me LOOK pregnant so he thinks... um. Yeah. So now I&#39;m just all big &#39;n bloated.&quot; You laugh at yourself and run a hand up through your hair. &quot;Hopefully it doesn&#39;t last too long, but if that ghost comes back at me, I&#39;ve got another dose of this potion to fool him again.&quot; 

You make sure the potion&#39;s tucked away safely in your pocket, get a few more pictures of yourself, your bulging gut, the room, that painting the ghost left through... 

Ok. Ok. [[Time to get some information.-&gt;Lib BookList 1]] </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="282" name="Lib BookList 1" tags="LIB" position="2470,2852" size="100,100">You sigh and sink back into the chair at the desk. With an irritable gaze, you place both hands on your engorged stomach and feel it like, maybe it&#39;ll go away in a few seconds? But after a full minute, you&#39;re still... &quot;pregnant.&quot; So, fuck it. 

You try not to think about it and scoot as close to the desk as you can without squishing your belly. You spend the next ten minutes or so skimming through the various papers scattered around the desk. You&#39;re very careful to leave everything as you found it-- who knows how Eliza has this stuff organized? 

Hey, there IS a little book list here! Or rather, there&#39;s a stack of reports-- printed, rather than handwritten, and it&#39;s got a bibliography with some sticky notes in Eliza&#39;s fancy cursive. 

You study the list and make a mental note of how she&#39;s got things organized. There&#39;s no official library system, she just seems to have everything in place alphabetically by //topic,// rather than title or author. A few books catch your eye, and you stand up to go find them. 

[[Soon you have a small pile of books,-&gt;Lib BookList 2]] and you spread them out on a reading table in the corner next to a chair. </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="283" name="Lib IW DrinkQuick" tags="IW LIB" position="2337,2799" size="100,100">You back away, you can hear him getting closer. There&#39;s a shuffling noise on the ground, almost like he&#39;s limping... getting closer and closer with each second. 

You take another step back, and... uggh, that potion&#39;s doing SOMETHING weird in your guts. You feel like you&#39;re being scrambled inside. You cringe and take another shaky step back and-- 

//Horrifically cold hands clasp your body tightly and jerk you against an icy body.// You yelp as your hips are yanked forward and you feel another guy&#39;s crotch against you. The ghost feels very strong; you&#39;d read that the Confederate army was starving to death for much of the war but clearly not the soldiers from rich families because THIS dude is pretty muscular, from what you can tell. 

&quot;You will bear me... a child... a son...&quot; his ragged voice whispers in your ear. 

&quot;I&#39;m a guy though,&quot; you say. Fuck, Eliza&#39;s potion can kick in any second now... 

**BLOOOPP** your lower body thrust forward and jerks, and the ghost moans in ancitipation, and your feet start to LEAVE THE GROUND as he lifts you upwards... **BLOOP** 

Both you and the ghost freeze in place. You stare with wide-eyes as you watch your abdomen bloat up, quite suddenly. Almost violently. It swells to the size of a soccer ball in two short little bursts, **BLOOP! BLOOP** and then the //pressure// hits you like an aftershock and you groan as your belly continues to inflate even though you already look... 

//pregnant...// 

Well SHIT! That&#39;s apparently how the ghost is gonna be fooled?? You feel his icy hands on your belly as your shirt rolls up to get out of its way. 

&quot;What FOUL WITCHERY IS THIS,&quot; the ghost snarls. He drops you and you stumble away from his freezing grip. &quot;YOU WERE TO BEAR ME A SON. HARLOT! Which one of the slaves did this to you, hmm? I&#39;ll have them FLAYED!&quot; 

Oh shit. Good thing you don&#39;t have to marry the fucker. 

You don&#39;t answer him, you just sort of stand there feeling your belly. Fuck, it&#39;s like all tight &#39;n shit... feels like you&#39;ve been packed full of ice cream or something, just something semi-solid that fills all your nooks &#39;n crannies. And yet it&#39;s rather lightweight? Like yeah, it takes up space, but you don&#39;t feel utterly hindered by extra weight. 

You definitely look the part though. You cover your mouth and pretend to be embarrassed. &quot;Um. It looks like you will not be, um, impregnating me. Today.&quot; 

&quot;Foul wench, fornicating behind my back,&quot; the ghost rants as his voice starts to fade into quiet sobs of abject despair. &quot;No sons... the estate shall pass into the hands of...&quot; and you never find out who. He&#39;s gone. 

... then again, maybe one of these books can shed some real light on the situation? 

You frown down at your bulging gut, fat and tight and firm like a ripe melon. When Eliza said it would fool the ghost, you were kinda thinking like... it would give you an illusionary gut or make you appear to him as a pregnant woman or something? But that it&#39;d be all fake and smoke &#39;n mirrors... you didn&#39;t actually think you&#39;d bloat up for REAL. 

You try walking a few steps. Ok. Ok. This is manageable at least. It&#39;s just like having a pillow shoved in your shirt, except it&#39;s real. You try to pull your shirt down, but there&#39;s just gonna be a breeze on your belly button and that strip of skin where your t-shirt just can&#39;t cover. 

&quot;... ok. So um.&quot; You aim your phone down at yourself, get a few different angles. &quot;Uhh. You guys see that? I&#39;m a little, uhh. Embarrassed. Didn&#39;t wanna show y&#39;all. But. The ghost in this room apparently wants to make people pregnant. So... the potion I drank to ward him off, makes me LOOK pregnant so he thinks... um. Yeah.

You get a few more pictures of your sheepishly swollen self, the ghostless room, that painting on the wall of the rebel soldier you suspect might&#39;ve been the very ghost who just touched you... 

Ok. Ok. [[Time to get some information.-&gt;Lib BookList 1]] </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="284" name="Lib BookList 2" tags="LIB" position="2615,2864" size="100,100">You get a picture of your chosen books, some of which are quite obviously cheap store-bought journals handwritten by Eliza herself. Then you fold your arms over your bloated tummy, and try to decide what to read first. 

**You don&#39;t have to read all of them.** 
In fact, you might not have //time// to read all of them. If the potion wears off and your belly shrinks back to normal, you don&#39;t wanna hang around and get FUCKED by that invisible ghost... 

Plus, it&#39;s starting to get quite late, and sooner or later you&#39;ll want to find a spot to curl up and sleep for at least a few hours before the morning. So you don&#39;t intend on reading them front-to-back, you&#39;re just going to skim for information, as college has well taught you to do. 

There is a modern-looking but well-worn composition notebook in Eliza&#39;s handwriting that says &quot;Catalysts and Reagents for Voodoo&quot; on the cover. 

You found an old leather-bound journal with a clasp. The pages are wrinkled inside, like they might have gotten wet. 

A slim old book with a torn spine and a blue cover is imprinted with the words &quot;Beasts of the Bayou,&quot; by someone named, stereotypically enough, Jim Bob LeRoux. 

There&#39;s a small, Gideon-Bible-sized book that just says &quot;Poetry&quot; on it. You don&#39;t see an author or even a set of initials anywhere. 

There&#39;s a two-pocket folder, modern-day, with some letters inside. You think they might have been written by one of the ghosts, when they were still alive. They look very old and yellowed, and are obviously not on notebook paper or computer paper. 

Finally, there&#39;s a large, heavy, dictionary-like book in curling leather. It has some writing and runes on it that you can&#39;t understand. It might be a spellbook! 

Which book do you pick? 

[[Eliza&#39;s notebook about Voodoo-&gt;VoodooNotebook]] 

[[The old leather-bound journal-&gt;LeatherJournal]] 

[[&quot;Beasts of the Bayou&quot;]]

[[&quot;Poetry&quot;]]

It&#39;s... ahhh, well, it&#39;s actually pretty boring. You weren&#39;t expecting a crash course in how to cast spells of your own, but it&#39;s more like... 

well it&#39;s almost like a recipe book! There&#39;s lots of lists of ingredients, including some stuff you&#39;ve never heard of, and lots of tips on how to prepare X potion or how finely to crush this ingredient, and in which direction to stir the pot... 

The ONE thing you take away from it is that some of her little, Blair-Witch style totems and stick figures... are actually fairly useful. Not from a flashy, wizard-y standpoint, but as wards against spiritual energies one might not want hanging around. 

Almost like good luck charms, but not always having to do with luck. Maybe you&#39;ll try making a few some day? For now though, you put her notebook aside. There&#39;s no reason to keep reading it when you don&#39;t have the means or the know-how to put into practice the crafts you&#39;re reading about. You snap a few pictures though, of some of the more interesting-looking, or fun-looking, ideas. 

You feel your tummy rumbling a little as you inspect the notebook. When you&#39;re done, you look down and realize you&#39;ve shrunk just a little bit. Is the potion starting to wear off? 

You can [[stop reading now and leave the library,-&gt;DoneReading Library]]  if you want. The door across the room from the main set of bookshelves, is quite obviously the one that leads into the second floor hallway. You can unlock it from here and head out to explore some more. 

Or, [[you can choose another book.-&gt;Lib BookList 2]] </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="286" name="LeatherJournal" tags="FP LIB" position="2783,3000" size="100,100">You open up the leather-bound journal. It&#39;s quite old, but well-preserved aside from some wrinkles and what looks like a little bit of water damage on certain pages. You peel them very carefully. 

It&#39;s the diary of one Waylon B. Roquefort, the original proprietor of this entire estate. Used to be a sugar plantation apparently. Slave-owner, but seemed to be one of the more &#39;kindly&#39; ones, not that it makes slavery forgivable. At least he treated them respectfully and fairly, even providing each adult a small allowance they could use as they saw fit. 

He fell in love with the cook, Violette, and... ohh goodness. Looks like he cheated. His wife... she was distraught and ended up cheating herself, with the guy&#39;s BROTHER, and... one day it looks like she just jumped off the roof in despair. 

And then Waylon&#39;s son! He&#39;s the fucking //wraith!!// The invisible ghost haunting this place, the one that tried to fuck you and is the reason you have this fake, bloated-ass belly making you look all pregnant... you frown and keep reading the diary. Waylon&#39;s son, James, looked like he was going to go off and do heroic things in the &quot;War of Northern Aggression.&quot; Except he got killed. Early. And never left behind a son. 

You fixate on a passage from later in the diary: 

&quot;... I know there is nothing that can bring back my family, and I know not why the LORD has seen fit to withdraw His grace from my home, but I am consoled by the affections of the lovely Miss Violette, whose soft presence reminds me of mother; indeed her cooking far surpasses any I have ever tasted, and my body grows large and rotund before my very eyes; day by day I seem to become bigger and heavier, but I do not mind anymore. I lose myself in the pursuit of knowledge, the collection of books, and one does not need a lightweight fit body to read, nor fill the brain with the wisdom of the centuries...&quot; 

He... comfort ate himself into the grave. He must have. His diary only extends for a few pages more, and he talks about how he&#39;s gotten too fat to leave his bedroom, and... is making arrangements. To have himself moved. And to leave the entire estate to the slave he fell in love with, having no surviving heirs... it sounds like he developed a nasty temper, as well: 

&quot;I am ashamed to admit I have become inconsolably angry upon a late serving of dinner, like a great beast demanding sacrifice, but my wrath is assuaged by such a fine feast fit for the kings of old, and I eat until I feel soon to burst; happiness and pleasure overtakes me and I call Violette in to cease her activities and attend to me personally, which she obliges...&quot; 

Shit. Some drama up in here! 

You wonder... is he perhaps, a ghost himself, haunting one of these bedrooms? Oof. Your belly rumbles and feels like it&#39;s starting to deflate a bit. You look down and see yourself shrink by about a half-inch around. Mmf. Feels better. But that might mean the potion&#39;s going to wear off soon...

It&#39;s not very well labeled. &quot;Swamp critters,&quot; &quot;furry critters,&quot; &quot;varmints,&quot; &quot;perverts,&quot; etc. But thankfully at the bottom you see a section labeled &quot;legends and fairy tales.&quot; 

So you turn there, and skim that chapter... bingo. A couple paragraphs about the //Rougarou.// Should help you out. You read them carefully... 

... they can&#39;t fucking count past 12?? What in the fuck?? 
Apparently that&#39;s a thing. People used to leave piles of 13 small-but-noticeable objects outside their house, such as pennies or stones. The monster would see them, realize there were more than 12, and attempt to count them. For hours. Possibly wasting the night away until the sun came back up and turned the Rougarou back into a human. 

Why 12? Midnight maybe? Like the monster&#39;s brain is only focused on the clock? They&#39;ve got to be similar enough and NOTICEABLE items, though, which would explain why the beast doesn&#39;t bend down to count blades of grass or whatever. 

A couple other things you discover. You don&#39;t need a silver bullet; extreme heat will work just fine to fuck up a Rougarou, as will decapitation. He&#39;s still a dangerous presence though. 

So, fire, and numbers higher than 12. Otherwise you&#39;re fucked if you can&#39;t hide in time, because the beast is immensely strong. 

REALLY fucked, apparently... judging by this little paragraph&#39;s worth of notes in Eliza&#39;s handwriting: 

&quot;rougarou is frequently extremely horny/ will catch and sex anyone he can/ prefers females but will take men as well/ can impregnate either, absolutely no idea how/ further study required, may need outside help/ deal with this later&quot;

You thumb through, skimming some of the poems that look ok. You&#39;ve never been crazy about poetry, it always seems to fly over your head. Too flowery and mushy. It&#39;s easier to read prose. 

You find one, though. &quot;Wisps.&quot; 

//Deep in the mire

and covet a body to keep. 

If traveling tired

you see a soft fire,

That sounds familiar. Have you ever heard of such a thing before? Wisps. Hmm. You read a few more poems, then realize your inflated belly is looking a bit DE-flated. How much longer before the potion wears off?

They start out in a barely legible set of handwriting, but soon enough, morph into beautiful, flowing cursive that looks perfect enough to be done by machine. They&#39;re written to various people, but all of them are signed 

&quot;Love and blessings upon you,&quot; 
&quot;--Violette.&quot; 

She was a slave here. You go back to her earlier letters and realize she was learning to read and write. Look how far she came! She cooked all the meals. She loved to cook, or rather, she loved to make people happy by feeding them the best cooking she could muster. 

And she fell in love with her master-- the owner of the entire property. Waylon. He specialized in sugar, it seems. Waylon B. Roquefort. Wealthy and learned and rather compassionate, it seems. The feelings were mutual, if Violette&#39;s letters are anything to go by. 

There&#39;s one written with big blotches where water droplets... must&#39;ve stained the ink, no. They&#39;re tears. You read what you can. He died. He died and left her the place. The entire property. He had no male heirs to leave it to, and he loved her so much that he freed her and left her the entire estate. Incredible. 

The letters after that are to some family members-- people with simpler names like just &quot;Joshua&quot; and &quot;Marie&quot; and &quot;Isaac.&quot; Probably fellow slaves? There&#39;s a letter to an attorney, and... 

Ohh no. 

The last one. 

&quot;To my darlings, my heart, all that is good left in the world

You must flee this place, and you must go now, and without me...&quot; 

It&#39;s heartbreaking. You read the final letter a few times. Violette warned her family and friends to flee, and she stayed behind. A lynch mob came to the house. She was the only person around they could take their hatred out on... And she warned her people not to try to save her, to save themselves.  

Poor Violette. You don&#39;t see any more letters after that. You wonder if her family ever even got this one, if they made it away safely... 

You look down when you&#39;re done reading; it looks like your bloated stomach has gotten a little smaller. The potion might be starting to wear off...

But you can&#39;t read the language it&#39;s written in? Much less TELL what language it is. Well shit! You thumb through some pages, and some more pages, and then you open the book about halfway-- 

A POOF of dust envelopes you and you start sneezing immediately. The fuck? You sneeze about ten times, shake it off, and then stare. 

This book&#39;s been //hollowed out.// Yeah, exactly. There&#39;s a great big square cut out of all the middle pages, and inside is...

Sheesh dude why are you so damn cold... &quot;go awwaayyy,&quot; you groan, and squint your eyes shut. You clutch your big mushroom friend close and try to go back to sleep, but Beau keeps shaking you, back and forth, back and forth, front-to-back, like, he&#39;s leaning over your back and you&#39;re sprawled over the ottoman-- 

What the FUCK is in your ASS??? 

You panic and glance backwards. There&#39;s no one there but there&#39;s... oh shit, there&#39;s a cock in your ass! You have a COCK IN YOUR ASS!!
 
You&#39;re being fucked!! You yelp and jerk forwards but you feel ice-cold hands clamp your body close to a broad chest and the invisible dick shoves deep inside you, and you feel this terrible, awful, no-good cold splurting way, way up in your bowels... 

You cry out in a mixture of fear and indignation, and you look down, and your belly is flat again and that potion wore off while you slept... 

and it&#39;s MORNING
and you&#39;ve been laying here all night trippin&#39; BALLS

and the ghost came back inside the library to cum inside YOU!!

&quot;//Son,//&quot; he whispers in your ear. 

There&#39;s nothing you can do now. You&#39;re wrapped in his clammy cold embrace and he&#39;s nuzzling your face and pulling out, and your ass is closing behind a dick that shouldn&#39;t exist in the first place... Fuck, it&#39;s so NASTY!! It&#39;s so cold!! How do you get it out?! Ugh, he fucked you right through your jeans, just... phased his cock right through the fabric, and... 

he lets you go and you slump forwards onto the mushroom--THE OTTOMAN again. Panting and violated and frightened and confused. 

Once you gather yourself together, you unlatch the library&#39;s main doorway and wobbly-walk downstairs, clenching your ass shut as if the ghost is gonna come try again. You make it out the door, and the day&#39;s just warming up all peaceful and placid like comPLETELY unCARING that you just got GHOST BUTT FUCKED... 

and you head for the boathouse and wait for Beau and say very little to him when he arrives in his airboat to take you back across. Your belly twinges and quivers every so often with its load of coldness. 

**END** 

You have been selected by the Invisible Wraith to BEAR his HEIR! 

You don&#39;t want to believe it at first, and you try to just make your video and keep on doing your channel like, nothing happened. Just put it behind you. Forget it happened. 

But after about a month, you&#39;ve put on some weight, or at least, it LOOKS like you&#39;ve put on some weight, and your subscribers are commenting with noticeable frequency that you&#39;re looking a little plump... 

and you have to come clean, and you hold a livestream where you tell them what happened and show them the footage. 

Much to your surprise, everyone is SUPER supportive of you and even a little excited, because hey, you have a ghost baby growing in your belly! You do your best to make the most of a bad situation and soon you have a series of videos starting up, documenting the months that go by with your otherwise completely male anatomy distorting and bulging to accomodate a big strong ghostly... 

Um ok it&#39;s kinda like an orb when it comes out and floats off, but hey. You did it! And it didn&#39;t even take nine months. Your subscribers, however, well //some// of them are asking where that mansion is, and you don&#39;t want to tell them because, dude no don&#39;t? And then SOME OF your subscribers... 

are asking you to do it again. </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="291" name="DoneReading Library" tags="LIB" position="2601,3002" size="100,100">You decide you&#39;re done reading for now, and to thank Eliza for her help, you figure the least you can do is put all these books away. You carry each back to where you found them-- hopefully. Ok, maybe you get a few wrong, but you&#39;re trying. 

As you do your duty, you can feel your clothes loosening back up again, as your poor engorged tummy deflates back to normal. Soon, your shirt actually fits once more. You check yourself out just to make sure it&#39;s worn off. 

Unfortunately this means that the invisible Wraith might target you again, so you&#39;ll need to be ready to... um. Gulp the rest of that potion down, and blow up once more and pretend you&#39;ve already been, um. Impregnated. Ahh well, at least it doesn&#39;t hurt. You grin, as you imagine pranking some of your friends with something like this potion. 

You unlock the door leading into the main second floor hallway, [[and step outside the library,-&gt;2nd floor later]] closing the door behind you. </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="292" name="2nd floor later" tags="" position="2199,3095" size="100,100">You&#39;re back in the second floor hallway. You&#39;ve already checked out Eliza&#39;s room and the library next to it at this end. There are two doors opposite you; one of them is open and is apparently a bedroom from what you can see of it. Might be a good place to sleep //later,// but you&#39;re not ready to conk out just yet. 

Instead, at the other end of the hallway, you are seeing a bluish flickering coming from under that doorway. The furthest doorway. You don&#39;t have any fancy ghost detecting gadgets with you but you&#39;d bet a thousand bucks there ain&#39;t exactly a rave going on in there. 

That&#39;s not going to be the invisible dude. He didn&#39;t even give off any light whatsoever to mark his position, just the occasional sweep of air. You should be able to safely check it out, and it is what you&#39;re here for after all. 

You pull your phone out to film it for a moment. &quot;Look at that shit, guys. Either someone&#39;s welding an art installation from scrap in there, or that&#39;s some motherfuckin&#39; ghosts!&quot; 

You head in that direction, but you pass by the top of the stairs on the way, and hear an odd sound. Sloppy-sounding, like something viscous and thick is oozing out of a container. 

[[Keep heading towards the glowing blue room.-&gt;FP OpenDoor]] 

[[Stop to check out that sound.-&gt;2F see the Slime]] </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="293" name="FP OpenDoor" tags="FP" position="1996,3100" size="100,100">You make it to the end of the hall without incident and hesitate at the glowing, flickering blue doorway... and then you put your hand on it, and push it open, leading with your phone on record. 

Inside, the room is very well-lit, with candles and a chandelier hanging up above. They&#39;re all aglow with an ethereal flame; each little source of flickering light is a pale blue. Not the same blue that you see from a butane lighter or a gas pilot light, that&#39;s a //dull// kinda blue, and this is more brilliant. 

It&#39;s a bedroom, as you expected. There are some bookshelves in here, enshrouded in circling clouds of ghostly fog. A few fancy chairs, a very opulent four-poster bed... 

And you see him. He fades into view quiet suddenly. 

He is a //devoutly// obese mountain of transparency, sitting upright in the bed with a book in his tiny little chubby hands. He&#39;s balding but with a big mustache like that old dude who appears on the &quot;Diabeetus&quot; commercials. It looks like he&#39;s wearing some kind of silken robe. Must&#39;ve had it tailor-made to his immense girth. He doesn&#39;t seem to notice you, yet. 

The gigantic fat ghost dabs at his mouth with a cloth napkin, then lays it over his chest like a bib. Then he slowly looks right at you. 

&quot;Well then boy, let&#39;s get to it, I am //thoroughly// famished.&quot; 

The fuck is he talking about?? You frown and lower your phone and look around. 

There&#39;s a cart sitting next to you, a fancy little tray-cart. 

... actually there&#39;s like ten of the fuckers. All glowing that same pale-white-blue ghost color. Ghost carts. Full of ghost food. 

You look back at the huge ghost. &quot;Um, did you want me to feed you? Sir?&quot; 

&quot;Well yes, of course, I... hmm. Are you new here?&quot; he squints over at you. &quot;My eyesight isn&#39;t what it used to be, most unfortunately.&quot; 

&quot;Uhh, yeah,&quot; you say, playing along. You... fuck, you have GOT to get a mounted camera so you can do things with your hands free. There&#39;s a little table next to the bedroom door; you thankfully have one of those phone cases that has a retractable stand for video viewing, or in this case, recording. Once it&#39;s propped up and aimed at the ghost properly, you [[reach for one of the food carts.-&gt;Feeding FP Start]] </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="294" name="2F see the Slime" tags="GOO" position="1894,2932" size="100,100">You creep to the railing, and take a peek over the bannister. 

The fuck is THAT shit? All over the floor down below, you can see like this... ugh, it&#39;s like a film of slimy shit. All glistening and slick-looking, like the floor&#39;s been frozen over with vaguely green goo... 

... and then you see it move. A big bubble of the stuff lashes upwards and then slaps down on the patch of bare floor in front of the stairwell. It then flattens out to match the rest of the gooey coating. 

You definitely don&#39;t want to risk going down there, nor letting that stuff touch you. You&#39;ll have to find another way down when it&#39;s time to leave. Across from the stairwell is a fancy glass door that leads out onto a lovely balcony overlooking the rear of the estate. Maybe you can find a way to climb down from there... 

For now though, you [[continue down the hall towards the glowing blue room...-&gt;FP OpenDoor]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="295" name="Feeding FP Start" tags="FP" position="1851,3103" size="100,100">You are able to grasp the ghostly food cart next to you, somehow. Are you really gonna cram food into this fatass ghost&#39;s mouth? What are you going to even get out of this?? You should just turn and head out the door, this is dumb! 

Unless... you can pacify him by feeding him enough food. In which case you&#39;ll have free reign to explore the room and see what other information you can discover. Maybe you&#39;ll uncover some secrets? If any sensitive information about the estate or its inhabitants exists, it&#39;s bound to be here in this room. 

Hey maybe you could just... ask him? Stop playing and just tell him what you&#39;re here for? But you don&#39;t wanna let your guard down around this big ghost, who knows what he&#39;s capable of...  

Probably not too much movement, that&#39;s for sure. Like he&#39;d be able to stop you if you just ignored him, or left the room. And yet, MAYBE, as you feed him, you can wring some information from him... 

Well. Your choice. Food&#39;s right next to you. 

[[Bring him a tray of food.-&gt;FP Feed 1]] 

[[Ignore him and search the room.-&gt;FP Roomsearch]] 

[[Dude no way am I FEEDING a ghost, I&#39;mma GTFO.-&gt;FP GTFO]] 

[[Come clean with him and explain yourself.-&gt;FP Explanation]] </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="296" name="FP Feed 1" tags="FP" position="1702,3161" size="100,100">You wheel one of the carts over to the bed and it moves just like a real cart, and you are able to pick up the tray full of food. It&#39;s nearly weightless. You set it on the bed. 

&quot;Ahh yes. Thank you m&#39;boy,&quot; the huge fat ghost says as he picks up bread and sauce from the tray. He dunks the bread and takes a bite. &quot;Mm. Fantastic. Violette has outdone herself again, I do declare.&quot; 

The ghost eats everything on the tray. He groans and rubs his big body once he&#39;s finished, and you watch with a mixture of horror and fascination as he swells up by about a hundred pounds-- not that it&#39;s easy to tell, as he&#39;s already so big, but he gets fuckin&#39; bigger. His robe falls open. The bed creaks. 

&quot;Ahh, yes. The second course, sonny,&quot; the fat phantom says. 

Sheesh, are you going to bring him more food? He&#39;s already gigantic! You could curl up inside him twice over and still have room for a 5th-grader! 

[[Hell no, he&#39;s had enough!-&gt;FP FeedPrematureStop]] 

[[Better do as he says, bring him another tray!-&gt;FP Feed 2]] </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="297" name="FP Roomsearch" tags="FP" position="1811,3289" size="100,100">You completely ignore the fatass ghost on the bed. 

&quot;I... I NEVER! Excuse me! How //DARE// you!&quot; he sputters and spits and scoffs. &quot;I can&#39;t BELIEVE this insubordination.&quot; 

You just walk on into the room and pretend like you don&#39;t even notice him. There should be some neat stuff in here. Maybe you&#39;ll discover some secrets or something? You pass his bed and head for the far side of the room. 

&quot;You rodent! You wasteful miscreant!&quot; the ghost says as you start rifling through some papers on a desk. &quot;I shall have you removed at once!&quot; 

&quot;Yeah yeah,&quot; you mutter. 

He goes very quiet, and when you look back, he&#39;s vanished. 
Well //that&#39;s// ominous. 

You wait a bit, looking all around the room, just in case he&#39;s done something. You don&#39;t see him. Or any odd, um. Anomalies. 

Which is great, because you can spend some time searching the room! You take some pictures and inspect the bookshelves... wouldn&#39;t it be great if one of them was like a secret passageway-opening lever that you pulled out aaaannndd...

.... nnnaah. Nope. 

You do find an odd little envelope though. What could it be? 

[[Open it.-&gt;FP WaylonsLetter]] </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="298" name="FP GTFO" tags="FP" position="2041,3244" size="100,100">&quot;Ok yeah you know what, no,&quot; you say, scoffing and chuckling to yourself. &quot;I am NOT cramming food into a 700 pound ghost&#39;s mouth. Bye.&quot; 

And you turn to leave. 

&quot;You won&#39;t... feed me?&quot; the rotund ghost says behind you. 

&quot;Nope, feed yourself. I&#39;m not a slave.&quot; You pick your phone up and then... 

You make an attempt at opening the door. It&#39;s locked. You jiggle the handle, then twist the latch above it, and it won&#39;t turn. It&#39;s stuck in place somehow. You slam yourself against it a couple times. You back up and kick it. 

The door glows blue-white in response to your violence, and you feel yourself tossed backwards. 

&quot;You won&#39;t... feed me???&quot; 

The ghost&#39;s eyes are starting to light up, an evil yellowy color like a haunted jack-o-lantern. 

[[&quot;Ok ok fine I&#39;ll feed you.&quot;-&gt;FP Feed 1]] 

[[Shit, try the balcony door, or the windows!-&gt;FP RefuseVo]] </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="299" name="FP Explanation" tags="FP badend" position="2217,3237" size="100,100">&quot;Ok listen, sir. I&#39;m not one of your slaves,&quot; you say. 

&quot;... I beg your pardon sir?&quot; the big ghost says. 

&quot;I&#39;m an investigator of sorts, here looking for signs of, uhh... shall we way, spiritual or ghostly activity,&quot; you admit. You hold up your phone. &quot;This device will allow me to record signs of activity from the other side, the afterlife.&quot; 

&quot;Why I do declare!&quot; the huge man says. The house seems to shake with his sudden pleasure. &quot;That&#39;s quite astounding, but you do sound rather a bit too young to be employed as such.&quot; 

&quot;I&#39;m what they call a self-made man.&quot; 

&quot;Likewise my good sir, likewise!&quot; says the big ghost, holding a hand out to you. &quot;Waylon B. Roquefort, at your disposal.&quot; 

You shake his hand, and introduce yourself. &quot;Perhaps you could direct me to any suspicious locations here on your estate, where you think spirits might be haunting the premises.&quot; Heheh. You don&#39;t mock his accent, but it&#39;s easy to slip some more fanciful words into your speech to make yourself sound more hoity-toity like Waylon is. 

&quot;Hmm. I don&#39;t rightly know, myself,&quot; he says, and pats his forehead with his napkin. &quot;Me and my family do not dabble in the occult, as a habit, and I am pleased to report that most of my employees have been successfully born again into the Good Lord&#39;s flock, but... perhaps a few of them still retain their old pagan ways, in secret. You have my permission to speak with them, as you please.&quot; 

&quot;Thank you very much,&quot; you say. &quot;Well, I&#39;ll go locate them and see what they know.&quot; 

&quot;Ohh but before you go, I insist that you partake of the bountiful delicacies my kitchen staff has prepared. You won&#39;t be hungry for //days,// sir!&quot; 

... eat ghost food? No thanks--

GULP. You stagger backwards. An incorporeal slice of pie just... floated over at high speed and forced itself down your throat, instantly! You feel it plop into your gut and dissipate, and within seconds you are groaning and clutching at your stomach. You&#39;re full. From ONE. Slice of pie. 

Waylon doesn&#39;t say anything else. You stare at him. His head, his face, is locked onto you like a security camera, and his eyes are glowing a bright yellow. Fuck, he doesn&#39;t even look like a person anymore, just a big round gargoyle, leering at you... 

And all around, the ghostly food from the carts is levitating up, up, up... 

You gotta get the hell outta here!![[You grab your phone and sprint for the door.-&gt;FP Exp Stuffing]] </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="300" name="FP Exp Stuffing" tags="FP badend" position="2357,3241" size="100,100">You smack into the door, and grab the knob and twist and... it&#39;s not turning?? It&#39;s locked what the hell? You grab the latch and turn that instead. 

It won&#39;t turn!! You&#39;re trapped! 

You turn back. Waylon&#39;s glowing yellow eyes are still fixated on you. Only his head turns to follow you; the rest of him remains motionless. 

Another ghostly food-item rockets your way-- a turkey leg, very classic. You duck your head aside and sprint across the room. There are big fancy windows and a pair of ornate French doors leading out onto a balcony, you can just open that up and-- 

FUCK THEY&#39;RE LOCKED TOO!!!

You yelp as that turkey leg catches up to you and pops itself into your mouth. You don&#39;t have to chew it, and you barely taste it, it just... slithers on down your throat whole, basically. You don&#39;t choke either, like you can still //breathe// as it&#39;s going down? But you can feel your throat bulging around it, and then it lands in your gut like a rock and you wince as you watch your belly puff up slightly. 

Sheesh! You gotta get out of here before you end up looking like HIM!! 

You can&#39;t get out the door, but maybe, [[you can kick it open??-&gt;FP ExpStuff Kick]]  

Or you can [[pick up a chair and smash one of the windows...-&gt;FP ExpStuff Smash]] </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="301" name="FP ExpStuff Kick" tags="FP badend" position="2475,3155" size="100,100">You anchor yourself, then raise a foot and slam it straight into the door. 

The door glows a bright blue-white and an equivalent force slams into YOU. It&#39;s like you bounced off it, but as a delayed reaction. You stumble backwards and feel a piece of ghost-food phase right through your back, past your spine, and into your gut. 

You sink to your knees for... for a moment, and you look back, and try to brace yourself. Waylon&#39;s eyes might as well be laser-designating you for the food missiles... they&#39;re all arrayed around you like some direct-to-video cartoon sequel or some other 90&#39;s G-rated schlock, circling above ominously... 

You start to stand up. 

[[A loaf of bread shoots towards your face.-&gt;FP ExpStuff End]] </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="302" name="FP ExpStuff Smash" tags="FP badend" position="2480,3298" size="100,100">You look around quick and pick up the nearest antique wooden chair, wind up for a throw, and launch it at one of the windows. 

It //bounces off the glass//, and there&#39;s a bright blue-white flash and a sound like a thunderclap. 

You wheel to face the ghost and his assault of phantasmal food. 
Waylon simply stares you down with his glowing eyelights. More food arrays itself around you like circling sharks; like a swarm of bees waiting their turn to attack. 

[[A loaf of bread shoots towards your face.-&gt;FP ExpStuff End]] </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="303" name="FP ExpStuff End" tags="FP badend" position="2632,3236" size="100,100">You try to duck and weave and dodge, but you can&#39;t dodge every single piece of ghost-food, and sooner or later one of them hits home and fills your mouth, puffing your cheeks out before rolling down your throat. That split second of you stopping to cringe and flinch, means another piece of food finds its way into your mouth. 

And then another. 

You stumble and fall as you try to run back for the door; you&#39;re desperate now, panicking, trying to hide, trying to flee... you don&#39;t make it very far before falling on all fours. 

You look up over your shoulder. The food is swirling around in the air above, waiting to pounce. You flip over and put your hand up as if to beg, but a piece of fruit swings down and fills your mouth before you can even get the word &quot;please!&quot; out. 

Ohh... gossshhh... you burp and **hic** and groan and grunt, and watch your stomach swelling up AGAIN, but this time with something much more solid and heavy. The cloud of food hovers closer and closer, just above your face, and one by one each item drifts down to be inside you. You sob as you turn your head from left to right, as you swing your hands up to bat them away, but nothing works, and they just... keep... filling you up... 

Soon you can&#39;t even tell what&#39;s what. Fruit, meat, bread, a drink, a pastry, a vegetable, stew, it all blends together into &quot;sweet,&quot; &quot;bland,&quot; &quot;salty,&quot; &quot;bitter,&quot; etc. and as your vision starts to go dark, all you can see is a great big round ball of flesh growing to blot the room out. 

**LATER** 

You cannot move from your spot on the floor, and lay there for hours and hours. Waylon&#39;s ghost disappears eventually once all the food has vanished into your distended mountain of a body. You pass out. 

You awaken to the sound of Beau&#39;s voice. &quot;Rise and shine, porkchop! Haw haw haw...&quot; 

You groan and cover your face. It&#39;s bright. It&#39;s morning. Oh fuck, your... uggh. You flop backwards and stretch and yawn. You don&#39;t feel anywhere near as bloated, thank goodness. 

You feel Beau&#39;s footsteps walk up beside you, and then OOF!! He like fucking LEANS on your gut, and... 

ohh

ohh NOOO. 

You&#39;re... you&#39;re fuckin&#39; FAT! 
You&#39;re gotten like. //Billowy!// You&#39;re like a damn marshmallow! You cringe and reach down and feel what USED to be a tightly-bloated drum of an abdomen, now soft and plump and squishy with fat. 

It&#39;s not just your belly that&#39;s round anymore... it&#39;s your whole damn body! You&#39;ve got a soft tubby keg in front of you, and your poor t-shirt&#39;s riding all the way up, revealing your padded back and love handles and fuck, you&#39;re just... spilling out of everything! Holy shit, your ass is just... 

&quot;Haa hahahaha!! You come up in this room, huh?&quot; Beau says. He gets off you and gestures around the place. &quot;This where the owner ate himself to death. Pulled a Diamond Jim, ate until he was ready to burst. I think it took like ten people to get his body moved...&quot; Beau smirks down at you and holds a hand out. &quot;I&#39;mma help you up but... I don&#39;t think you gonna fit on my boat outta here. So you&#39;ll have to wait for me to borrow a bigger one.&quot; 

Beau helps you plod downstairs. You&#39;re fucking HUGE. You&#39;re like way past &#39;obese&#39; levels. You sway with every step and you feel like the house is grumbling at having to support your weight on its old structures. 

He leaves, and you spend some time cringing at your reflection in a mirror in the front hall. Then you try to walk around a bit. Good fucking grief, the ghost food fattened you up like a fucking HOG. You&#39;ve probably tripled in weight, maybe even more. 

How are you gonna LOSE all this?? 

**END** 

You have been ENLARGED by ghostly gluttony! Gaining and engorging to great girth, you&#39;ve grown into a gargantuan, gigantic gurgly galumphing

ok ok I&#39;ll stop

point it, you&#39;re fat as fuck now, and how the HELL are you gonna face your subscribers like this? 

Luckily on the ride back, Beau tells you that &quot;ghost fat&quot; is actually a lot easier to lose than uhh, &quot;regular&quot; fat, but you&#39;re still gonna have to lose it! And there&#39;s a LOT. It&#39;s going to take you all year, at least! And you&#39;re going to have to come up with a good explanation for having gained multiple HUNDREDS of pounds... 

or just tell everyone what happened. You&#39;ve got footage of it, right? But that&#39;s going to involve fucking showing the world that you sat there and had a bunch of ghost food shove itself down your throat... 

welp. have fun being BIG! </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="304" name="FP RefuseVo" tags="FP badend" position="2048,3390" size="100,100">Ohh shit he&#39;s goin&#39; all //Exorcist// on you! You race across the room and slam into the French door that leads onto the balcony. 

You //bounce off,// like it&#39;s made of rubber. You see it glowing blue-white as well, and it sort of ripples... the fuck is this shit?? 

The ghost disappears. You freeze. You scan the room. 

A pair of glowing yellow eyes appears over by the door. 

&gt;&gt;feedmefeedmefeedmefeedmefeedme&lt;&lt;

The eyes disappear. 

They reappear RIGHT NEXT TO YOU
&gt;&gt;FEEED MEE&lt;&lt;

&gt;&gt;FEEDME&lt;&lt;</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="305" name="FP VoEnd" tags="FP badend" position="2048,3531" size="100,100">A massive force slams into you, bowling you over. You roll sideways to get to your feet-- but you look up, and see the gigantic round ghost hovering above you. His eyes shine a sickly-looking yellow. 

&gt;&gt;**I MUST BE FED**&lt;&lt; his ethereal voice reverberates throughout the room. His lower body looks cloudy but he&#39;s floating there a few feet off the ground, completely mobile, and he reaches down and grips you under your armpits. 

&quot;Nonono!! Lemme go you asshole!&quot; you kick and wriggle and struggle. The big soft hands are clamped tightly around your chest. You are lifted higher, and higher, and HIGHER. High above the ghost&#39;s face. He flickered back and forth from normal-looking to a more deadly, shrunken, gaunt look, and his mouth opens, ohhh FUCK it&#39;s like that thing Pennywise from //IT// does!!

Except there&#39;s no lights and his mouth keeps opening wider and wider, until it looks like you could-- 

You plunge downwards, directly into the ghost&#39;s gaping maw. He just stuffs you inside. Just like that. Crams you in. 

You can see his cloudy white insides all around you, and you sink down, down into his body like a pillow made of marshmallows; he feels gooey and slick, and you keep sinking, until-- 

&quot;Ow!&quot; you snap as you bang your knees on the ground. You nearly faceplant. 

You&#39;re out of the ghost though?? You phased through him. Where the fuck... he&#39;s gone!!

You get to your feet and look around. There&#39;s no sign of him. He just like, ate you?? Probably absorbed your lifeforce or something, ugh, you feel all woozy and tired. You&#39;re probably just rushed from adrenaline, it&#39;ll pass... 

You shiver, and you feel rather cold now. You hunch forward slightly to lean on your knees, staring down at the floor and WHAT&#39;S WRONG WITH YOUR FEET. 

They&#39;re like disappearing!! What the fuck!! You yelp as you see your feet fading, your shoes becoming transparent, and holy shit it&#39;s spreading upwards, to your legs, you reach down to get your shoes off and you CAN&#39;T TAKE THEM OFF

You pull your pant leg up and there is NOTHING UNDERNEATH

You hold your hands out in front of you and whimper as you see them disappearing as well, or rather, fading, losing all your natural colors and going all ghostly-looking... you lift your shirt up and can&#39;t even see anything anymore, it&#39;s like you ONLY have a figure when your clothes are covering your body, and somehow they&#39;re affected by this too! 

You cringe as you feel the fading, freezing sensation travel up your chest, up your neck, and turn your head as if to avoid it and keep your face above the surface of a cold lake... but you sink right in like a stone. 

You didn&#39;t even leave a body behind. You just... turned into a ghost, directly. 

**END** 

You have become a GHOST! 

You rush through the house, passing through everything you touch, and sometimes you float like there&#39;s no gravity, and other times you walk normally, and you don&#39;t have to open doors... you just go through. You&#39;re not here. You&#39;re not even on this plane of existence anymore. 

You head over to Eliza&#39;s room, panicking, and... and are not allowed inside. Her voodoo must be keeping the ghosts out of that room, and that includes you now, apparently. 

You haunt the house all night, your undead brain racing to find solutions to this problem, trying to figure out your limitations and abilities. And soon you realize an even worse situation. //You cannot leave the house.// 

You&#39;re stuck here. Your only hope is that Eliza will be able to help you when you can catch her outside her room... or that some friends, family, or subscribers of yours will show up here looking for you after a few days of inactivity. 

Hopefully none of them befall the same fate! As if this house needs any more ghosts haunting it. </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="306" name="FP WaylonsLetter" tags="FP" position="1799,3422" size="100,100">The envelope is of course, quite old, and brittle, but you are careful to open it with minimal damage. It&#39;s still sealed after all these years-- with //wax.// You pull out the letter inside. 

&quot;To my dearest Violette,

If you are reading this then I have long passed on. Fear not, I shall see you again one day. For now, your careful attention: 

In the event that your neighbors find your presence and proprietorship distasteful, and attempt to remove you through force or other means, I recommend you slip out the back and head north into the trees. A small boathouse has been constructed in secret; I had it built in case the Yankees made it this far South. The key is on my person at all times-- it has my initials engraved on it.

Please use the small boat inside to flee. It would trouble my soul greatly to know you had befallen a poor fate amongst those fellow Southerners who refuse to respect my final wishes for this estate. 

Forever Yours, 
--Waylon&quot; 

The key? It&#39;s in this envelope. You pull it out and look at it. 
A sense of bitter dread fills you. This letter never made it to the intended recipient. 

Well, you pocket the key. At least now you have a chance to escape the island, should you find yourself needing to GTFO. You don&#39;t like the idea of paddling away in a rowboat, in the middle of the night, in a gator-infested swamp. But hey. Beats being hunted down by a werewolf, right? 

You head for the door of the room. 
As soon as your hand touches the doorknob, you hear a sick gurgly, bubbly noise on the other side. [[You back away from the door.-&gt;FP AltRoomEsc]] 
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="307" name="FP AltRoomEsc" tags="GOO" position="1810,3567" size="100,100">All around the edges of the door, you see a slick green slime start to ooze through the cracks. You make sure the key and your phone are tucked safely away in your pockets and run for the opposite side of the room. You throw open the balcony door, and close it behind you, just as the room&#39;s main door is burst open by a HUGE amount of gelatinous green goop. 

It&#39;s an amorphous, slightly transparent, mobile pile of sludge. Looks a lot like green Jello, to be honest. 

You stare through the window as the room&#39;s door shuts, and the ghostly blue lighting flickers back on, and the blob monster-thing tries to approach you but is repulsed by the balcony door like there&#39;s some kind of force-field or something. 

And you see the scarily obese ghost of Waylon sitting on the bed again. You can&#39;t hear him speaking, but he seems to be talking to the slime monster. Which is shut inside the room with him... 

You don&#39;t wanna hang around to see how this goes. [[Time to get your bearings-&gt;FP AltRoomEsc 2]] and decide what to do next. </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="308" name="FP AltRoomEsc 2" tags="" position="1662,3574" size="100,100">You&#39;re standing on the master bedroom&#39;s balcony two stories above the ground-- although the mansion is such a tall building it&#39;s really more like //three// stories. 

You scan the ground, and the area. The mansion was built facing **SOUTH**, which is the direction you are currently facing as well. Off to the right-- //west//-- you can just see the small footpath leading down to the boathouse you arrived at earlier this evening. 
Up ahead is what used to be an orchard, full of dead trees, and beyond that is a cemetery. And beyond THAT, all the way at the southernmost point of the island, is another, smaller orchard along with what looks like a fallow, flat, fenced-in field that may have once been used for other crops. 

You know that Waylon&#39;s letter said the secret boathouse was to the **NORTH**, which would involve going around the house, or dropping to the ground and heading through the house so you can leave out the back way. Front of the house is South, Back of the house is North. Remember that. 

Thankfully you don&#39;t see any large, werewolfy-looking shapes moving around. Climbing down is going to be an ordeal, either way. Hey wait... 

Maybe climbing //down// is not the answer. You have a couple chairs to work with, and you stack them up and are able to reach the roof and pull yourself up. You lean against the shingles. It&#39;s steep, but you make a short little agoraphobic hop and grasp the edge like Lara Fuckin&#39; Croft, and with a few grunts and some footwork, haul yourself up and over. 

There&#39;s a cupola up here, open-air, like a gazebo on the roof. You enter it and find a staircase leading [[back down into the house.-&gt;HeadingOut from FP]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="309" name="HeadingOut from FP" tags="IW" position="1499,3580" size="100,100">You&#39;re on the upper floor once more, and as you approach the stairs you move quietly and take a peek over the edge of the railing. 

Looks... clear? Shit. How about that. You don&#39;t see or hear anything unusual. 

As you start to head downstairs, you hear that invisible ghost&#39;s voice behind you. You rush down the stairs quickly as possible. He doesn&#39;t seem to be following you. You can still hear him hissing about &#39;heirs&#39; up there though. Looks like you&#39;ll be saving Eliza&#39;s little potion for something else. 

At the foot of the stairs, you can see that both the front and back doors of the house are shut. 

Would you like to head out front, or out back? 

[[Front Door-&gt;Leave Front]] 

[[Back Door-&gt;Leave Back]] </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="310" name="FP FeedPrematureStop" tags="FP badend" position="1671,3299" size="100,100">You scoff and push the cart away from the bed; it vanishes. &quot;Don&#39;t you realize how big you&#39;re getting? Haven&#39;t you had enough to eat?&quot; 

&quot;Noooo nonono I want MOOORRRE!!&quot; the obese ghost wails. He tips his head back and wails like someone just kicked his sandcastle in at the beach. Very unbecoming for a supposed rich plantation owner... 

&quot;Nah. You&#39;re too big. If I feed you any more, you&#39;re going to blow up,&quot; you say. 

&quot;**MMMMOOOOOORRRRRREEE**&quot; the ghost roars. His eyes light up a bright shining yellow and he locks onto you, and his mouth opens WIDE. Very, very wide. 

Unnerved, you stagger backwards and reach for one of the trays. The ghost&#39;s image flickers out of existence for a moment, but then he reappears at the edge of the bed, coiled to pounce like a lion. You grab for more ghost food... 

It&#39;s not there. None of the trays... it&#39;s all gone! 

&quot;**MMMOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOORRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRREEE!!!!!!!**&quot; 
The huge ghost suddenly FLIES at you, crashing into you like a bowling ball. You roll over backwards and attempt to right yourself, but great big squishy hands clamp around your body, under your arms, and pick you up. 

You are lifted high into the air. The ghost no longer looks strictly //human,// per se; his eyes are all lit-up and his face is distorted and stretched like a chunky Ghostface from //Scream,// and you can see his twisted, deformed skeletal structure through his skin... 

Suddenly the ghost shoves you into his mouth. 
Stuffs you in, just like that. 

You can see his cloudy white insides all around you, and you sink down, down into his body like a pillow made of marshmallows; he feels gooey and slick, and you keep sinking, until-- 

&quot;Ow!&quot; you snap as you bang your knees on the ground. You nearly faceplant. 

You&#39;re out of the ghost though?? You phased through him. Where the fuck... he&#39;s gone!!

You get to your feet and look around. There&#39;s no sign of him. He just like, ate you?? Probably absorbed your lifeforce or something, ugh, you feel all woozy and tired. You&#39;re probably just rushed from adrenaline, it&#39;ll pass... 

You shiver, and you feel rather cold now. You hunch forward slightly to lean on your knees, staring down at the floor and WHAT&#39;S WRONG WITH YOUR FEET. 

They&#39;re like disappearing!! What the fuck!! You yelp as you see your feet fading, your shoes becoming transparent, and holy shit it&#39;s spreading upwards, to your legs, you reach down to get your shoes off and you CAN&#39;T TAKE THEM OFF

You pull your pant leg up and there is NOTHING UNDERNEATH

You hold your hands out in front of you and whimper as you see them disappearing as well, or rather, fading, losing all your natural colors and going all ghostly-looking... you lift your shirt up and can&#39;t even see anything anymore, it&#39;s like you ONLY have a figure when your clothes are covering your body, and somehow they&#39;re affected by this too! 

You cringe as you feel the fading, freezing sensation travel up your chest, up your neck, and turn your head as if to avoid it and keep your face above the surface of a cold lake... but you sink right in like a stone. 

You didn&#39;t even leave a body behind. You just... turned into a ghost, directly.

As if this house needs any more ghosts haunting it. </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="311" name="FP Feed 2" tags="FP" position="1564,3132" size="100,100">You cringe as you pull another tray over to the bed. This time, when you place it on the bed next to him, he shakes his head. &quot;I&#39;ll need it up here,&quot; he says, patting his rounded chest. 

&quot;... ok.&quot; You hold the tray carefully and kneel on the bed as you scoot it across his belly, up to his chest. 

&quot;Ahh. Very good.&quot; 
And the fat ghost packs the food in once more. You don&#39;t even know what he&#39;s eating. It looks meaty and creamy. Once again, he finishes the tray very quickly and grunts and groans as his body engorges even //larger,// he&#39;s fucking ball-shaped, for sure. He&#39;s like 80% belly at this point. 

&quot;Third course! Another boy, come come now.&quot; He snaps his fingers at you. &quot;I&#39;m not much for this world but by God I&#39;m going to taste every delicacy in existence before I depart.&quot; 

This is absurd. Are you going to feed this ghost even MORE food?? Do you really expect him to eat all ten of those trays?

[[Might as well give him what he wants,-&gt;FP Feed 3]] bring him his third course! 

[[Fuck no, this is getting ridiculous...-&gt;FP FeedPrematureStop]] </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="312" name="FP Feed 3" tags="FP" position="1431,3140" size="100,100">&quot;Good heavens I am stuffed,&quot; the big fat ghost says as you wheel over a third tray of food. His hands fold and perch atop his gut. &quot;Gracious me. Yes another tray though, heaven&#39;s sake. Mmf.&quot; He grunts and grumbles and chews. He belches. Ugh. 

You put the tray up on his chest like before. &quot;Ohh glory be, biscuits and gravy and sausage and mmfff--&quot; he&#39;s already cramming the food into his mouth. His chunky, stubby hands move with unexpected deftness. This time he starts getting fatter even before he&#39;s finished eating; his big body emits ominous groans and grumbles and gurgles... and he grows, and grows, and swells, and engorges. 

The third tray disappears from his chest and he flops back against the headboard. The phantom is now... at //least// the size of a vending machine. Like a fridge. Like you could fit an entire grocery store freezer&#39;s worth of goods inside him. 

&quot;Well boy?&quot; he asks, panting, and looking at you. For a moment his eyes flicker yellow. Spooky... 

Holy crap though, he still wants more food! 

[[Give it to him!-&gt;FP Feed 4]] 

[[Dude fuck no, this is enough already!-&gt;FP FeedPrematureStop]] </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="313" name="FP Feed 4" tags="FP" position="1294,3164" size="100,100">&quot;Oof! I do declare....&quot; 
The fat ghost is panting heavily and his tiny-by-comparison hands are rubbing every inch of his body they can reach. Which is... not a lot. His arms have grown with the rest of him and he&#39;s almost like, that kid from the //Christmas Story// who couldn&#39;t put his arms down because his mom made him wear like 20 layers of winter coat? 

You approach with a fourth tray, and he waves you closer and nods. &quot;I... I&#39;m afraid I&#39;ve become unable to feed myself, son. I&#39;ll need you to put food directly in my mouth.&quot; 

Aww FUCK. That&#39;s just great. Well, this is keeping him happy and so far nothing bad has happened to you, so... you sigh and kneel on the bed, beside his shoulder. You pick up each piece of ghostly, transparent food and pop it into his mouth, one by one. 

&quot;Mmmhmmhmmhmm!!&quot; he moans in gluttonous bliss as his body continues to bloat out of control. He&#39;s like a globe with arms and legs and a head. He&#39;s enormous. You finish the tray as quick as possible and it disappears from your hands. You hop down off the bed. 

&quot;Ohhh dear me,&quot; he whines. &quot;... food... precious food...&quot; 
You cringe. Ugh, how... stereotypical? 

Welp. There&#39;s more trays to feed him. Shit, his body&#39;s so huge he&#39;d probably take up an entire hot tub all by himself. And all the water would spill out. 

[[Better stop feeding him now.-&gt;FP FeedSucc]] He didn&#39;t exactly ask for more, at least not yet... 

[[Another tray for the master!-&gt;FP OverFeed]] </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="314" name="FP FeedSucc" tags="FP" position="1496,3295" size="100,100">&quot;Ahhhh yes, yes,&quot; the fat phantom says. He closes his eyes. &quot;I... that will be enough for now, boy.&quot; He yawns. And then he beckons you over. &quot;I have one final task for you.&quot; 

&quot;Huh?&quot; You carefully step closer to the bed. 

&quot;The letter. Get the letter to Violette,&quot; he says. &quot;It&#39;s in the bookshelf over there.&quot; 

He smiles, and starts to snore. 

The letter? Hmm. You walk over to the bookshelf he pointed at. Sure enough, amongst all the books, sticking out in a way that it&#39;s almost invisible unless you look from the side, is an old yellowy envelope. 

You retrieve it and [[open it,-&gt;FP SuccLetter]] noticing that the fat phantom has completely disappeared from the room, along with all his ghostly lighting effects. </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="315" name="FP OverFeed" tags="FP badend" position="1341,3320" size="100,100">Heh. You bring another tray over to him. &quot;Still hungry?&quot; you ask. 

&quot;Ohhhh,&quot; the fat ghost&#39;s head lolls back and forth. His mouth hangs open as he pants. His dome-like body rises and falls. It&#39;s almost cartoonish how he looks fit-to-burst. 

You tip the tray over his mouth. &quot;Open wiiiide,&quot; you mutter. The pastries and desserts slide off the tray into his open maw, tumbling down, down into darkness, and swelling his figure to the maximum--!!

There is a house-shaking, ear-splitting BOOM like a thunderclap, like a firework went off 5 feet above your head. You fall backwards off the bed. It takes you a second to recover and right yourself, but you see large ghostly-blue-white orbs racing all around the room as they fly away from the fat ghost&#39;s position. 

He EXPLODED. 

You get to your feet carefully, ducking under an orb as it flies overhead. They each look to be about the size of a basketball or so, moving quickly and leaving a streak of pale white behind in their wake. 

And they disappear into the walls, one by one. 
Soon the room&#39;s empty aside from yourself. 
You glance around. &quot;Wow,&quot; you say. You grab your phone and set it on the foot of the bed, then move to vlog some more. &quot;So you guys saw that, right? Ghost kept asking for food, and I fuckin&#39;...&quot; 

An orb comes flying out of the wall behind the bed, straight for your body! You feel it slam into your gut and push you back a little bit, and //instantly// your belly blimps up like you just gained about 50 pounds. 

&quot;THE FUCK??&quot; you gasp, your body rigid with shock as you stare down at your new weight-- and then //another orb// smacks into your back, and merges with you, and all your clothes tighten up as your body adds another 40-50 pounds of pure fat. 

You have about a second more to hold your hands up and look at your plump new fingers and chubby new arms, at your belly protruding below and hiding your feet... before the REST of the ghostly orbs come flying back into the room. 

Schloop, schloop, schloop! One, by, one, they, fly, at, you, and, make, you, grow! Like kamikazes, the orbs make a beeline for you in sequence, one after the other, and your fattening body sucks them in like soup. Like noodles. You can only stand there in shock and horror, as each orb further fattens you up. You are actually //growing taller.// Your body has no room for all this fat and you&#39;re stretching up bigger and bigger to make space for all your additional mass. 

You fall back onto your ass and feel your immense rolls of pudge cover your feet. You jiggle every time an orb slams home. Soon your belly and chest are so massive, you can&#39;t see ANYTHING in front of you but your own flesh and a few feet of ceiling. Your clothes have long fallen to pieces. 

The last of the orbs enters your body, and you top off at possibly OVER a half-ton. 

**END** 

You have been filled with GHOSTS! 
The phantom&#39;s criminally obese mass has been added to your own... in addition to all the ghostly FOOD he ate before he popped. Which means you are an utterly vast blob of pudge that might in some ways still be recognizable as human. 

You can barely even talk. Your jaw has almost no room to open. 
MOVING is out of the question, except for your eyes. 

And you can hear all of the little ghostly orbs, speaking in hushed voices, deep inside your body. You can&#39;t understand what they&#39;re saying but it&#39;s going to drive you mad, you know it. 

You sit there all night, eventually passing out, and then in the morning Beau finds you and claps a hand to his forehead and mutters something about getting you some help. He brings Eliza into the room. She appraises the situation for a moment, asks you some questions about what happened, and then shrugs. 

&quot;You can&#39;t help me??&quot; you manage to squeak out. 

&quot;Well I can slowly extract the ghosts, but it&#39;s goin&#39; to take a long time mon,&quot; Eliza says. &quot;I mean. You goin&#39; to be here like a couple weeks. And since there&#39;s ghost food up in there ALSO makin&#39; you fat, that&#39;s gonna stay. I can&#39;t get that out, you gonna have to lose that on your own.&quot; 

Fucking. GREAT. </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="316" name="FP SuccLetter" tags="FP" position="1502,3430" size="100,100">The envelope is of course, quite old, and brittle, but you are careful to open it with minimal damage.

Well, you pocket the key. At least now you have a chance to escape the island, should you find yourself needing to GTFO. You don&#39;t like the idea of paddling away in a rowboat, in the middle of the night, in a gator-infested swamp. But hey. Beats being hunted down by a werewolf, right? 

You can [[leave the room now,-&gt;HeadingOut from FP]] if you wish. 

Or, you could take a moment to [[check out the balcony,-&gt;FP SuccBalcony]] since you probably won&#39;t come back up here. Might be a nice view? </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="317" name="FP SuccBalcony" tags="" position="1649,3430" size="100,100">You&#39;re standing on the master bedroom&#39;s balcony two stories above the ground-- although the mansion is such a tall building it&#39;s really more like //three// stories.

You know that Waylon&#39;s letter said the secret boathouse was to the **NORTH**. That&#39;s out the back of the house. Front of the house, South. Back of the house, North. Remember that. 

Thankfully you don&#39;t see any large, werewolfy-looking shapes moving around. You&#39;re a little nervous about leaving the house, but you still want to explore the grounds a bit. You might have fallen asleep earlier, but you&#39;re exhilirated and hopped up on adrenaline now, and you feel quite brave. 

You leave the balcony, and the master bedroom, [[opening the door to the hall.-&gt;HeadingOut from FP]] </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="318" name="Leave Front" tags="" position="1053,3388" size="100,100">As soon as you&#39;re just outside the front door, it slams shut and locks itself. Loudly. Irritably. The hell? You push and pull on the door. It&#39;s... shit, the house has locked you out?! 

The porch wraps all the way around the entire house, with fancy columns and shit, you know. Rich people stuff. It&#39;s a fairly safe path to walk, in terms of being easy-to-see in the dark of the night. If the moon weren&#39;t out and providing plenty of light, you&#39;d probably stay indoors because it&#39;d be pitch black. 

A short walk up ahead is a path that leads to a cemetery, where all the graves are above-ground stone tombs or mausoleums. It&#39;s the only thing of interest out that way; there&#39;s no sense in exploring the dead orchards or that empty crop field. 

To the right is the footpath that leads to the boathouse where Beau docked his airboat earlier. 

You decide to: 

[[Head to the boathouse.-&gt;Boathouse After FP]]

[[Head to the cemetery.-&gt;Cemetery Entrance]] 

[[Go around to the back door.-&gt;Leave Back]] </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="319" name="Leave Back" tags="" position="1048,3244" size="100,100">As soon as you&#39;re just outside the back door, it slams shut and locks itself. Noisily. Angrily. The hell? You push and pull on the door. It&#39;s... shit, the house has locked you out?! 

Well it can&#39;t be helped. You stare out into the darkness. 

A path stretches out onto the northern area of the island before you, into the trees. You can&#39;t tell where it leads, but it wouldn&#39;t have been placed if it didn&#39;t have a purpose. 

You&#39;re pretty sure you can see some lights flickering in the trees, sort of like a campfire? You&#39;ll have to get closer to be sure. 

You can definitely see a side path leading off to the right-- the east side of the island. What could be over there? More vegetation obscures your view beyond a certain point. 

Take the [[straight path, up ahead.-&gt;RearNorth Hub]] 

Head down the [[path to the right.-&gt;East Path]] 

Go back around the house, [[to the front door.-&gt;Leave Front]] </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="320" name="Boathouse After FP" tags="RG" position="1197,3325" size="100,100">You crunch along the footpath to the boathouse. A dark grove of trees blocks your vision to the left. A few more obscure the house and your right, as you walk. 

There&#39;s the boathouse. You freeze up as you see a pair of glowing red-orange eyes in the water beyond. Actually you see... at least five pairs, scattered about. Bright, orangey, reddish, gleaming eyes. 

Alligators. Multiple large carnivores. Not enclosed behind any bars or cages or zoo pens. Not being watched by trained professionals who can subdue out-of-control dangerous beasts. 

Just right there, within 100 feet of you. 

You almost don&#39;t notice the huge black shape perched atop the boathouse until you see the great big werewolf jaws open in a yawn. The fucking ROUGAROU is //sleeping on top of the boathouse.// How the rickety little shack supports his weight is anyone&#39;s guess, but you quietly back up until you&#39;re over the little rise in the path and around the slight corner. 

And you //stay// quiet until you&#39;re back at the house. You try the front door again. Nope. Still locked. 

Welp. 

Did you want to [[check out the //cemetery//?-&gt;Cemetery Entrance]] You are here to see ghosts after all, and what better place to look than a place where the dead are buried //en masse//? 

Perhaps you should just [[head around the back of the house-&gt;Leave Back]] though. </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="321" name="Cemetery Entrance" tags="TD" position="1202,3498" size="100,100">Your feet crunch the gravel path below. You are heading straight for the island&#39;s cemetery. You find yourself wondering why the owner of the mansion would have placed the burial plots here, in //front// of the mansion... but as you draw closer, you see a lot of signs that the graveyard was once more of a &quot;lovely garden where the dead just happen to be buried.&quot; You see the twisted old remains of what probably used to be beautiful trees and hedges and flower bushes... some peaceful-looking statuary... a nice fancy gate. 

Now everything is overgrown with weeds, choked with oddly ugly ivy, thorny bushes, just... unkept and wild and unpleasant. Not to mention the oddly misty feel of the place. An owl hoots somewhere in the distance. VERY stereotypical of it. 

If you&#39;re feeling unnerved, you can always just avoid this place and [[head for the back of the house.-&gt;Leave Back]] 

Or you can press on, [[through the fancy iron gates-&gt;Cemetery]] . There had better be some sweet McFuckin&#39; Ghosts up in here, &#39;cuz this place is //damned// creepy. </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="322" name="Cemetery" tags="TD" position="1202,3650" size="100,100">As soon as you enter the cemetery, your neck prickles, and you feel as though you&#39;ve made a dreadful mistake. There&#39;s no one else here, and you try to shake the sense of foreboding as you pull your phone out to film some shots. 

&quot;So apparently this far south, they bury their dead in graves above-ground, because of flooding,&quot; you say quietly. You rove the camera over a crumbling mausoleum. &quot;And of course this is a rich family, who owned this place... so they&#39;re bound to have some fancier burial grounds...&quot; 

Your phone dies. The battery was like, 40%! And suddenly it flashes empty and turns off. &quot;Dude what the fuck?&quot; you snap, trying to turn your phone back on. 

&quot;What&#39;s the matter?&quot; says a supremely rich and smooth voice. 

You turn and see a man leaning against a tall headstone. He absolutely was not there before... but he&#39;s real. He&#39;s not a ghost, rather. 

&quot;I... where&#39;d you come from?&quot; you ask. 

&quot;Oh, here and there,&quot; he says. &quot;Phone not working?&quot; 

&quot;... no...&quot; You pocket it and take a [[closer look at him.-&gt;The Devil 1]]  </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="323" name="RearNorth Hub" tags="" position="909,3246" size="100,100">You&#39;re heading deep into the northern reaches of the island now. You can still see the big white mansion behind you when you look back, but only because of the moonlight hitting it from above. Otherwise, everything&#39;s quite dark and you&#39;re surrounded by trees, droopy moss, crickets and frogs... 

Up ahead you can see some man-made light. It&#39;s off to the left. It looks like it&#39;s coming through a window?? There&#39;s... there&#39;s a little cabin. Just off the path. 
No wait. 
There are //multiple// cabins. They&#39;re very small; each one looks to maybe have a single room. They&#39;re clustered off the path, hidden in some trees... likely considered unsightly when viewed from the opulent mansion to the south. 
You realize what they are. These are where the slaves lived-- were kept. 
You wonder why some of them are lit. 

They are clearly not places where boats are kept though. You don&#39;t have to check them out, but you can&#39;t help but be curious. Why are there lights on inside them? 

What do you do? 

[[Keep heading north-&gt;RearNorth Hub2]] and leave them alone for now. 

[[Stop to check them out.-&gt;Slave Cabins]] </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="324" name="East Path" tags="" position="945,3532" size="100,100">You walk down the closer path, heading towards the east edge of the island. It&#39;s very dark amongst all these tall, mossy willow trees. A faint breeze blows through the branches, making them rustle and setting you on edge. 

You pull your phone out for a sec, but... can only stare forlornly at the empty battery notification flashing on the dark screen. As if you didn&#39;t feel vulnerable enough already! 

As you approach a small incline in the pathway, you see it diverge. To the left is a little dirt footpath, leading into the trees, and as you draw level with it, you can see something light up about 20 feet ahead. 

Straight ahead, the gravel path leads to what looks like a small fishing pier stretching out 30 feet or so onto the swampwater. 

Which way do you go? 

[[Left, to the light.-&gt;Shrine to Mammy]] 

[[Forward, to the fishing pier.-&gt;Fishing Pier]]

That much has to be said. He&#39;s taller than you by a few inches, built slightly larger but lean and light. He&#39;s wearing a cream-white suit and twirling a matching hat around his left index finger. 

And he&#39;s just. So handsome. Very, very aesthetically shaped. He&#39;s got such a nice-looking face that if he hadn&#39;t just appeared from nowhere, you&#39;d trust him immediately. 

&quot;So what are you doing out here, where the werewolves and witches hunt for prey?&quot; he asks you. 

&quot;... witches?&quot; 

&quot;Eh. One Witch, Two Witch, old witch, new witch.&quot; He shrugs, and puts his hat on before walking up to you and extending a hand. &quot;I had to stop by the old place and see how things were going. Didn&#39;t expect to see someone like you here.&quot; 

&quot;Like me?&quot; You shake his hand. 

&quot;Yeah, like... what do they call &#39;em nowadays. Normies? Muggles?&quot; The guy rolls his eyes. &quot;Someone not involved in acts of sorcery, witchcraft, divination, alchemy, et cetera et cetera.&quot; 

&quot;Well I&#39;m definitely not a &#39;normie,&#39;&quot; you say with a grin. &quot;I&#39;ve got a paranormal investigation channel; I&#39;ve...&quot; your face falls. &quot;I came here to check out the supposed hauntings, but I&#39;ve already gotten a lot of footage, and... I&#39;m just amazed the ghosts are REAL this time.&quot;

But I think I&#39;ve already SEEN all the ghosts, and I think it&#39;s time to get the fuck outta here before that werewolf gets me... or worse.&quot; 

&quot;Ohh the //werewolf,// hahaha... I remember when that happened,&quot; the guy says. Fuck, every time he smiles, you just feel so //charmed.// And not really in a gay way? But kinda? But more just a disarmed, chilled, &#39;this guy&#39;s got charisma and connections&#39; sort of way. 

&quot;When... what happened.&quot; 

&quot;When that goofy kid got himself turned into a werewolf. Or //Rougarou// as they call it around here.&quot; The suited man folds his arms, looking around thoughtfully. &quot;Pretty sure he was just trying to bulk up to impress some girl at the time, but now he just... runs all over creation lookin&#39; for something to eat, or someone to fuck.&quot; The guy has the faintest hint of an accent, but it&#39;s not Southern, and you can&#39;t quite tell... 

You shrug. &quot;Well... I guess basically, I&#39;m just trying to secure an escape route. Not sure I want to leave //just// yet but I want the option open.&quot; 

&quot;Hmmm... I might be willing to help you with that, but...&quot; 

There&#39;s always a catch, isn&#39;t there? You fold your arms and tilt your head at him. &quot;You want a favor? You want money?&quot; 

&quot;Ehh, a favor might be nice,&quot; he says with a smirk. He pulls out a coin. 

&quot;You know I just realized we never exchanged names,&quot; you say, and you [[hold out a hand and offer yours.-&gt;The Devil 3]]  

</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="327" name="The Devil 3" tags="TD" position="1508,3861" size="100,100">&quot;You can call me Mr. Starr,&quot; he says. &quot;Two R&#39;s.&quot; He flicks the coin between his fingers deftly as he he looks you up and down. &quot;I&#39;m thinkin&#39; you&#39;ll do just right for a certain uhh, shall we say, courier service I need taken care of.&quot; 

&quot;So... you get me off the island and I&#39;ll deliver something for you?&quot; you say. 

&quot;Actually I&#39;m thinking we flip for it.&quot; Mr. Starr&#39;s smile is quite blinding; his teeth are perfect. Did the top of his shirt come unbuttoned at some point? 

&quot;... ok. So what&#39;s the deal then?&quot; you ask. 

&quot;Uhh... you call heads or tails,&quot; he says smoothly, showing you both sides of the coin. It doesn&#39;t look American, that&#39;s for sure. Looks ancient, but it&#39;s not a trick coin at least. 

&quot;If you win, I get you off the island, no strings attached. If you lose, you&#39;re gonna do me a solid and... make some deliveries.&quot; There is something //off// about this guy, you swear... he&#39;s just too damn perfect-looking. 

&quot;Ok, and these deliveries, is this something that&#39;s gonna get me in trouble, ruin my reputation, if I get caught?&quot; you ask. &quot;Why should I accept your help instead of just getting off the island under my own power?&quot; 

&quot;Because it&#39;s midnight, and you&#39;re in the middle of a pitch black, alligator-infested swamp.&quot; Mr. Starr chuckles. &quot;I&#39;ve seen the boat you&#39;re thinking about using. It&#39;s a classic Cajun flat-bottomed boat. Barely enough room to sit down in. You have to use a pole to push it along. You have no idea where to go and would be lost in the bayou for hours... days... maybe even permanently.&quot; 

What do you say to that? 

[[&quot;Alright, let&#39;s flip for it.&quot;-&gt;Devil CoinFlip]]

For a split second you think you see long black nails on his fingers, but... must be a trick of the light, because when you look again, he&#39;s completely normal. 

&quot;Yeah, no. Appreciate the offer but I think, if the boat&#39;s not viable, I&#39;ll find another way.&quot; You turn to leave. 

&quot;Well. I hope you have a plan for dealing with that werewolf... If you change your mind, I&#39;ll be here. Or there.&quot; Mr. Starr shrugs. &quot;I suppose I could offer an alternative as well, if you&#39;d rather just pay me directly.&quot; 

You take a moment. 

[[Ask him about paying for his services.-&gt;Devil Reset]]

Mr. Starr holds up a hand. &quot;I already said I didn&#39;t need money. I want something else.&quot; 

&quot;... I hope you&#39;re not about to ask for a sexual favor.&quot; 

&quot;Why, you offerin&#39;?&quot; he smirks. &quot;Nah. I want... //memory.//&quot; 

You raise an eyebrow, but then give a start as the graveyard warps in your vision as though you were drunk. Everything darkens until you can only see a few graves around yourself and Mr. Starr, who&#39;s raised his hands high and is making some REALLY weird gestures. 

The night turns blue and black and purple. Dark flames rise from the stones. The dust becomes mist. 

&quot;Subtleties, deceit, occlusion,&quot; Mr. Starr&#39;s voice echoes through your very core. He brings his hands to his sides, outstretched as though crucified. 

You swear you see a pair of massive devilish wings unfurl behind him. 

&quot;Just relax,&quot; he cooes. &quot;You won&#39;t feel a thing.&quot;

&quot;Mm.&quot; Starr nods and takes a sip of-- where the FUCK did he get that shit? He&#39;s got like a martini glass in his hand! &quot;Love Rougarous. So much fun to watch in action. Just. Great big fuckbeasts. Awesome predators too.&quot; 

&quot;Is there a way to like incapacitate him? For a few hours until the sun comes up?&quot; 

&quot;There&#39;s a //couple// ways my man!&quot; Starr chuckles. He tips his drink back and you watch as the glass disappears. He&#39;s definitely a magician or something... &quot;There&#39;s the 13-count trick. They get confused by numbers higher than 12, so, if you lay out like 13 objects in front of them, they&#39;ll stop to count, and get all bamboozled and sit there counting for HOURS.

&quot;But otherwise,&quot; Starr shrugs. &quot;They usually chill out once they&#39;re no longer hungry or horny. So. If you can find a way to placate them that way, without getting yourself caught in the process...&quot; 

&quot;Great.&quot; You sigh. 

Starr smirks. &quot;There //is// one other way...&quot; and he holds his hand out, and you see a bubbling little glass bottle appear in a small puff of indigo smoke. &quot;You could drink this. It&#39;d even the playing field, for sure.&quot; 

&quot;What is that, some kinda repellent?&quot; you ask. 

&quot;Only one way to find out,&quot; Starr says-- over your shoulder. You blinked, and he vanished and reappeared with an arm around your shoulders and that bottle dangerously close to your face. &quot;Go on, have a sip. I guarantee you the werewolf on this island will stop trying to eat you.&quot; His thumb pops the cork off deftly. 

This is REALLY sketchy. Not only is Starr clearly a supernatural being or at least, a wielder of the arcane, but... well. You&#39;re just a bit unnerved. Still, he IS offering to help you circumvent that pesky monster roaming the island. 

Do you take him up on his offer?

&quot;Yeah,&quot; he groans.

Oh shit. OH SHIT.

**END** 

You are lying peacefully in your bed, ready to get up but enjoying just a few more minutes of comfort and warmth. Eventually you stretch a few times and yawn and get out of bed to go get some coffee and breakfast. 

Once you&#39;ve got your fuel for the day, you sit down at your workstation. It&#39;s a nice setup for the bargain prices you paid for it. You check your phone for messages or calls, and then check your emails, and your channel. 

You&#39;ve got some messages, asking about your recent trip. What trip? The last trip was a month ago, are they asking about that? 

Apparently not. Your followers seem very confused about your schedule. You weren&#39;t planning on visiting Louisiana anytime soon. But they keep saying you are, and you went, and you should have some video footage to show off... 

You film a short little vlog with your webcam-- nothing formal or properly edited, just a quick explanation showing them there&#39;s no &quot;plantation videos&quot; on your phone, and what are they all talking about? And you haven&#39;t left the state since last month&#39;s trip. And you don&#39;t even know about this place they keep saying... some French name you can&#39;t read. 

You do spend some time lurking on a chat server your subscribers have set up, just reading what people are saying about you. It&#39;s probably not a good habit to have, but you like to hear their feedback when you supposedly aren&#39;t listening. Some of your subscribers are saying that something must have happened to you on your trip, maybe something traumatic? 

But you didn&#39;t GO to a... &#39;Manor De Ren and Stimpy&#39; or whatever it&#39;s called?? You haven&#39;t been to Louisiana in recent memory at all, and... why are your subscribers so fixated on this?? Who gave them this false information?? 

Ahh well. Looks like some of them are making plans to visit this mysterious location themselves. Maybe they&#39;ll find some answers... or maybe someone&#39;s just been spreading rumors about you. Hmm. 

Welp! Time to start planning your next video! </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="336" name="Devil FF Ending" tags="TD TRIM" position="546,3825" size="100,100">You&#39;re back in the clearing where you //parked your car earlier!!// 

You look around. You don&#39;t see Starr anywhere. &quot;Uhh. Thanks?&quot; you say. 

&quot;Just get outta here,&quot; his voice says faintly in your ear. &quot;Go home, make your damn video, show the world some ghosts...&quot; and then he&#39;s silent. 

You get in your car. 
Ohhh your car. So nice. To be in your car again. You want to hug it, except it&#39;s a car, so you settle for clutching the steering wheel for a few minutes while you take some time to relax. 

Finally, you&#39;re ready to leave. 
You start the engine and slowly pull away from the swamp onto the winding dirt road, shrouded by trees. 

[[It&#39;s good to be leaving.-&gt;Esc Chase RG]] 

AN-TRIM</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="337" name="Devil MpregEnabled" tags="TD badend" position="1498,4106" size="100,100">&quot;Oh, it&#39;s fairly easy,&quot; Mr. Starr says. He grins. 

His eyes have turned completely black. He has fangs. He has horns. His skin is red. &quot;You might even enjoy it. You&#39;ll be getting laid a lot more, that&#39;s for sure.&quot; 

You recoil backwards in sudden fear, and bump into something behind you. You blink and Mr. Starr is gone, but a pair of big red hands reach around you to clasp you around your chest. 

&quot;You&#39;re going to deliver... some agents. Into the field for me.&quot; His deep, smooth voice sends pleasurable vibrations through your core. He presses one of his hands against your stomach. 

&quot;Deliver... what??&quot; you cringe and try to squirm out of his grip. You twist back to look at him. 

He&#39;s absolutely huge. A tall, muscular, powerful demon. He&#39;s like. He&#39;s like 8 feet tall or higher now. The epitome of stereotypically &#39;demonic,&#39; and yet you don&#39;t feel like he&#39;s gotten any uglier if that makes sense. 

His hand pushes your shirt up and continues to press into your gut, harder. Incomprehensible letters and marks and runes swirl over your skin, glow bright orange, and then vanish. 

You cry out, in both pain and pleasure. Deep in your bowels, you feel something you&#39;ve never felt in your entire life. You have no words for the sensation. It&#39;s not something you think a man is capable of describing because you have nothing to compare it to. 

But you moan, uncontrollably, with lust, as Starr lifts you up and tugs your jeans off and shoves his entire cock into your belly. It doesn&#39;t hurt. It slides right in, and you let him. You don&#39;t resist in the slightest. 

&quot;The first one&#39;s mine,&quot; he croons in your ear. &quot;After that, I don&#39;t care. Go crazy.&quot; 

And he begins to cum in your belly. It doesn&#39;t feel like anything at first, but you start to feel the hot flashes, the pulses and throbs, and you gasp as you realize how full you&#39;ve already gotten. 

Within seconds your abdomen is starting to bulge out and puff up, in rhythmic pulses, like a heartbeat thumping out of control. You pant hard as you try to breathe despite the pressure of your body being filled with demon cum. Starr just. Keeps. Cumming. 

You pass out when you feel hot sticky cream flowing up from your belly into your throat and pouring out your mouth like spilled milk. Something squirms in the deepest pits of your bowels. 

**END** 

Your body has been repurposed into a //demon breeding machine.// 
Starr takes you back to your car and drives you home and he just... he just hangs around. Explaining some things to you that you try not to listen to. There&#39;s no doubt that you&#39;re FUCKING PREGNANT though-- your belly&#39;s all tight and bloated and firm like a ball, and there&#39;s little bumps and squirms inside, and you keep. Getting. BIGGER. FUCK. 

And yet when Starr, or... or any dude around you, really... when you&#39;re too close, or someone smirks at you or just stares for too long. You start to feel flushed and lusty and submissive. 

Starr hangs around your apartment like the smell of burnt popcorn for a couple days, watching you swell up with his little imp-baby, until one day you head for the toilet and drop the fucker right in the bowl. It teleports all over the place, growling, a little cherubic horned baby-thing... ugh. UGH. THAT came out of you. Great. 

Starr picks it up, cuddles it, and waves at you. &quot;Hope you&#39;re ready to make a LOT more of those... &#39;cuz every time someone fucks you, that&#39;s what&#39;s gonna happen. Have fun!&quot; 

That prick. 

He&#39;s right, too. What he fails to mention though, is that you now seem to emit some kind of potent pheromone or something, because you TRY to go to the gym for a workout like you usually do, and... and there&#39;s just... there&#39;s some //nice// BIG dudes lifting weights, and they follow you into the locker room and just... fuuuck they just like gangbang you and it feels great and you waddle outta there all stuffed and sloshy and grinning like an idiot...

&quot;Hey, we can try again if you want. I&#39;ll let you use one of yours.&quot; 

You&#39;re not sure you HAD any change in your pocket-- oh wait, you DO have a couple quarters and a dime. You pull one of the quarters out.

&quot;Aww. Too bad. Well that was a waste of time,&quot; he says, his smile starting to spread wider. 

As does his chest, and his arms. He&#39;s growing. FUCK. What have you gotten yourself into-- He&#39;s CHANGING. He&#39;s got horns. His skin is turning a bright devilish red shit shit shit. 

&quot;Don&#39;t worry though,&quot; he says as he looms over you, 8, 9 feet tall maybe... &quot;I&#39;m not after souls. I&#39;ve got a much better use for you. More fun, for the both of us.&quot; 

&quot;You said I&#39;d be making //deliveries!//&quot; you say, backing away, horrified. 

&quot;Yep!&quot; Starr says. He grins a fanged grin. You see a pair of massive wings beating slowly behind him. &quot;Deliveries for me. All for me. But first, I have to give you the proper //equipment.// C&#39;mere you.&quot; 

His very very large warm hands wrap around your body and lift you up. Everything goes black.

You open your eyes and immediately let out a wild, slutty moooaann and clap your hand to your mouth. You have the absolute craziest, hardest, most intense boner you&#39;ve ever had, and... and you&#39;re rocking back and forth and... 

oh shit

you whimper as the world fizzles into view around you, and you can&#39;t tell where you are but it&#39;s dark and there are candles everywhere, on the ground, floating through the air, upside down, every which way. And glowing lines, letters, runes. 

&quot;Figured I&#39;d take us someplace private and cozy,&quot; Starr&#39;s deepened, demonic voice says. 

He&#39;s fucking you. His hands pull your knees open and he leers down at you, leaning in to give you a peck on the cheek. 

&quot;Where am I?&quot; you whine. He&#39;s got a big fat demon dick inside your ass. You don&#39;t feel injured or hurt, but you can see its outline pressing into your stomach, which is bare... you&#39;re completely nude. You&#39;re floating... no, FUCK, you&#39;re impaled on his dick and hanging there off him like a towel, like a doll, a tablecloth... 

&quot;This is my little... ehh. Let&#39;s call it a &#39;pocket dimension,&#39;&quot; Starr says. A large clawed hand splays long fingers over your belly, which suddenly glows and swirls over with brilliant orange-and-red runes in a language you&#39;ve never seen. &quot;It&#39;s the perfect place to keep breeders like yourself.&quot; 

&quot;Breeders??&quot; 

&quot;Yeah! What&#39;d you think you were gonna be delivering, magazine subscriptions? Spirital pamphlets? Tupperware?&quot; Starr starts laughing. &quot;Nah. You&#39;re gonna be my special boy and bear me some IMPS. And maybe if you&#39;re a good boy, I&#39;ll let you back into your astral plane every so often to walk around and do some banal mortal things.&quot; 

He bites his lip and squints and wrinkles his nose, and starts to cum. Intense heat explodes into your bowels, like a hearty warm chili but from the wrong end. In two pumps you&#39;re full. Two more pumps and you&#39;re bloated. And Starr doesn&#39;t pull out until he&#39;s done, at which point you look like you&#39;ve gained about fifteen pounds. There&#39;s got to be a gallon or more of demon seed sloshing about in your tummy. 

Starr brushes his lips against your swollen gut. &quot;Mmm. Nice and pregnant. I&#39;ll leave you here to bake that lil bun, and come back and fuck another one into you in a bit. Probably shouldn&#39;t have accused me of cheating, you know. I tend to take that personally. I was gonna just fuck ONE baby into you and then leave you to your devices, in //YOUR// world. But. But now.... hehehehehehe. I think I&#39;m gonna just keep you for myself. Ta-ta for now!&quot; 

And just like that, he vanishes. You drop a few feet and land on a malleable surface, but //everything is too dark// and you can&#39;t see anything but the candles and the writing. And the soft glow starting to fade from your tummy. 

You squirm as something wriggles about inside and presses its face against your skin. You scream. You&#39;re pregnant. You have a demon baby in you. You&#39;re a guy and you have a THING INSIDE YOUR GUT and there&#39;s nothing you can do about it and you&#39;re stuck in some kind of hell... 

And you can&#39;t leave. </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="340" name="DevilRG TransformEnd" tags="TD RG end" position="1791,3981" size="100,100">&quot;Ok, I mean I guess, but what if I--&quot; 

Before you can put forth any conditions or further queries, Starr simply pops the bottle&#39;s mouth past your lips and tips the salty-sweet potion down your throat. You go a little cross-eyed as you look down at it, and it&#39;s kinda GROSS like a mix between KoolAid and shitty fair popcorn that&#39;s more butter than corn. You squint your eyes shut. 

&quot;Drink up!&quot; Starr says happily, before tossing the bottle over his shoulder. He gives you a thump on the back, and you sort of swallow without wanting to, making you wince. 

You stick your tongue out. &quot;Blech. Dude I wasn&#39;t ready to drink it JUST yet--&quot; 

&quot;Well I just, I thought I heard him coming, that&#39;s all,&quot; Starr shrugs as he walks away from you. He leans back against another tall headstone and crosses his arms, smirking. &quot;But don&#39;t worry. Once that takes effect in a few seconds, you won&#39;t have any more trouble with Mr. Rougarou.&quot; 

You shiver violently; the potion&#39;s doing some //weird shit// in your gut. &quot;Well, //gee,// I sure hope not. What was in that stuff, anyway--&quot; 
Your shivers build to a crescendo and suddenly, you feel like you&#39;ve blown up a bit-- it&#39;s like a weird bloating feeling but //everywhere,// rather than just your stomach. You&#39;re feverish all of a sudden, as well. You tug at your shirt. Why the fuck does it feel so tight? You&#39;re sweating bullets, just like that! 

Your hand cramps up as you tug at the neckline of your shirt; at the same time your face and ears tingle and prickle with odd warmth. You look down at your hand and watch it GROW, like an inch in every direction. You gasp, and watch the growth spread up your arm, to your shoulder, your lean frame packing on bulk you&#39;ve never had before. 

&quot;Starr?!? Yo, what the fuck man?? What&#39;d you do to me?&quot; 

&quot;I&#39;ve given you //strength,// hmm?&quot; Starr giggles. He wraps an arm around the tall, cross-shaped headstone he&#39;s standing by, and swings around it like a stripper pole. &quot;You get to grow into a BIG man now! I never understand why, in like movies and shit, you human dudes always freak out when you start experiencing transformations where you&#39;re getting bigger muscles. I&#39;d think you would be HAPPY about that.&quot; 

&quot;Well I mean THAT&#39;s cool but--&quot; you double over, cringing, shaking, and GROWING. Fuck, you can hear like, your bones popping and shaping, and your muscles all... eewwww it sounds like someone&#39;s //stirring you.// You stagger this way and that as changes envelop your body. You fall to all fours, and watch as straight-up FUR spread down your arm, over the back of your hand, and claws pop out of your fingers. 

And your ass clenches and your back cracks all the way down and OHH SHIT you&#39;re growing a tail!! 

[[Holy FUCK you&#39;re turning into a werewolf too!!-&gt;DevilRG TransformEnd2]] </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="341" name="Devil RejectAll" tags="TD" position="1335,3519" size="100,100">You frown and shrug him off you. &quot;Uhh, yeah no. I don&#39;t think so.&quot; 

&quot;Well aren&#39;t YOU a tough customer,&quot; Mr. Starr says with a dramatic sigh. &quot;I guess I&#39;ll just have to find someone dumber. Too bad Beau&#39;s //already// a werewolf, I was really hoping to watch a transformation this evening. There&#39;s always this moment when a horny Rougarou turns, where his dick just like... &#39;SPROIINGSS&#39; up and you can see that //sweet sweet lust// taking over his brain...&quot; 

Starr grins at you, and you see a small pair of horns sprout from his forehead and curl backwards. You back away from him. 

&quot;Ahh, suit yourself,&quot; he shrugs. He snaps his fingers and a cloud of smoke, purple and blue crackling with blackened lightning, rises from the ground to consume his form. You can just make out the shape of vast demonic wings spreading behind him. &quot;If he catches you though, I&#39;mma come watch him impregnate you, and you&#39;re gonna WISH you&#39;d agreed to my assistance... heheheheheh...&quot; 

Starr vanishes, and you&#39;re left alone in the graveyard. 

You sit on a headstone for a minute, letting your brain work through everything you just saw. Ok ok. One thing at a time. Starr was a demon or something. And... and he like ALMOST just turned you into a werewolf? If you&#39;d drank that potion, you&#39;re almost 100% sure you&#39;d be huge and covered with fur right now. And uhh... what was that about impregnation? You shudder. 

Ok. Ok. Just relax. Time to head back and pick somewhere ELSE to go. 
You walk back to the mansion, the doors of which are still locked, and head around the porch to the rear, where there is a path behind the house leading out onto the northern grounds of the estate. 

[[You take it.-&gt;LeaveBack Cem]] </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="342" name="LeaveBack Cem" tags="" position="1066,3514" size="100,100">A path stretches out onto the northern area of the island before you, into the trees. You can&#39;t tell where it leads, but it wouldn&#39;t have been placed if it didn&#39;t have a purpose. 

You&#39;re pretty sure you can see some lights flickering in the trees, sort of like a campfire? You&#39;ll have to get closer to be sure. 

You can definitely see a side path leading off to the right-- the east side of the island. What could be over there? More vegetation obscures your view beyond a certain point. 

Take the [[straight path, up ahead.-&gt;RearNorth Hub]] 

Head down the [[path to the right.-&gt;East Path]] </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="343" name="Shrine to Mammy" tags="mammy" position="1078,3648" size="100,100">You head into the embrace of a vast willow tree, like a deep green dome-- or rather, it WOULD be if it was daylight outside. So it&#39;s really more like a black dome that obscures everything, except for a little tealight sitting at the base of it, flickering merrily with a tiny flame. 
You frown as you approach, and kneel before it. What&#39;s up with this random candle? And uhh. Who lit it? And uhh... where are they now? 

In response to your line of mental questioning, you see another little light flicker into existence to your right. And then up above. Except these don&#39;t have candles. They&#39;re just tiny little tongues of flame, burning with no wax or wick. Floating in midair. 

More light up, causing no harm to the tree or its leaves or any foiliage around you whatsoever. You look all around and watch the inside of the willow&#39;s canopy light up with little orange flames. 
Soon you realize that there are many of Eliza&#39;s little fetishes and totems all hanging above, from almost every branch and twig. Small piles of stones lay here and there between the roots. 

Right in front of you, carved into the tree trunk, is a series of concentric circles. In the middle of all of them is the name &quot;Violette.&quot; You look closer and see a bunch of smaller words, ringing her name: &quot;innocence, purity, charity, kindness, gentleness, mirth, understanding,&quot; and so on and so forth. 

All of the lights blink out once more, except for a few above you. You take a step back from the tree and follow a line of tealights up the trunk, like Christmas runner lights leading your gaze. 
When they stop, you see a rope hanging from a branch above your head. 
It is twisted into a noose. You stare at it for a few moments. 

This can only be a place where an injust lynching took place. You hang your head and close your eyes, in respect for the dead. 

[[Soon you return to the gravel footpath.-&gt;East Path]] </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="344" name="Fishing Pier" tags="HF" position="942,3681" size="100,100">You step onto the wood planks of a pier. It&#39;s got a horizontal section mostly level with the shore, and then it extends out into the water a ways. It&#39;s a couple feet up above the ground, and further above the water. Presumably to avoid alligators and flooding, though as you look out across the water and see a few pairs of gleaming orange eyes, you find yourself feeling decidedly unsafe here. 

There&#39;s a small shack at the left side of the pier. It sits half on the shore and half-over the swampwater, on stilts. Looks like a rickety little one-room deal. The door opens up and a guy walks out. His bare feet slap on the wood; you can&#39;t make out his features. Looks like he&#39;s wearing a straw-hat... looks kinda chunky, too. Oddly proportioned. 

Shit, you hope he&#39;s not like some kind of deformed hillbilly with anger issues and a vaguely sexual relationship with a chainsaw. That would suck. Is it... is it even a guy? You can hardly tell, it&#39;s so damned dark... 

He suddenly sniffs the air and looks in your direction. &quot;Hey. HEY. Who&#39;s over there?&quot; 

You don&#39;t answer immediately. He&#39;s got, well... he sounds mostly male? But he also sounds like he might be a bit on the younger side. Or maybe this person is a somewhat masculine girl? You&#39;re gonna call him male for now until you get a better look, or hear otherwise. 

&quot;Y&#39;all c&#39;mon out &#39;fore I get the gun and mistake you for a varmint!&quot; And he holds up what looks to be a plastic, battery-operated lantern. 

Sheesh, what&#39;s wrong with his FACE?? He looks like a fuckin&#39; FROG or something!! 

What do you do? 

[[Introduce yourself-&gt;FrogChat Start]] and hope for the best.

&quot;Ohh thought you might&#39;ve been Beau for a sec,&quot; the young man says. He holds up a web-fingered hand and shakes yours. &quot;Joseph. Joe, please.&quot; 

You give him your name. You&#39;re finding it hard not to stare. 

He sighs. &quot;Ok look, yeah. I&#39;m a frog. Go on, look. Everyone does.&quot; 

&quot;I, I mean, I&#39;m sorry? I&#39;ve just--&quot; 

&quot;Never seen a real live frogman before, I get it, I get it. That&#39;s why I hang out here, so I ain&#39;t gotta deal with the stares anyway,&quot; Joe says. 

He&#39;s, um. Yeah. He&#39;s basically a big, anthropomorphic frog. Looks almost like something out of //Ninja Turtles.// Except not a turtle. He&#39;s got a big wide face with a very large mouth, and no hair or anything, just slick green-and-white-and black-striped frog skin all over. He&#39;s wearing a dirty tank-top and a straw hat, with a reed clenched in his mouth, and umm... no pants or anything. 

His body&#39;s definitely frog-shaped, with a thick core and powerful legs meant for jumping long distances. He looks kinda chubby though-- like, he&#39;s got a noticeable pot-belly that pokes out from under his shirt. 

&quot;Looked enough?&quot; he sighs. 

&quot;... yeah. I&#39;m sorry, I really am, I... I&#39;m not trying to be rude or anything,&quot; you say. &quot;Um. So... how are you? This, uhh... fine, werewolf-y evening.&quot; 

&quot;Ohh, is Beau runnin&#39; wild again? Dumb fucker.&quot; Joe scoffs. He shakes his head and plods off down the dock. &quot;Well, good luck dealin&#39; with him.&quot; 

Was that... an end to the conversation? How do you respond? 

[[Ask for his help.-&gt;FrogChat Help]]

&quot;Come back here VARMINT!!&quot; the frog-guy yells. You chance a quick look backwards and see him coming OHH FUCK HE&#39;S LIKE running on all fours or something!!! You&#39;re in for it now!! 

At least he didn&#39;t bring his source of light with him! You&#39;ve got a chance to escape, as you head up over the small inclined area of the path and break line of sight for a few seconds. 
**Straight ahead,** if you keep running, you&#39;ll come back to the main path, and then it&#39;s just a left up to the house, or a right deeper into the island. 

Ahead and **to the right,** though, there&#39;s that path leading to the big willow tree. It&#39;s closer, which is both good and bad: you&#39;ll get into cover quicker, but he might //see// you sooner than you can hide. 

You better make a move fast before he catches up to you! 

[[Keep going straight, to the main path!-&gt;FrogRun StraightSplit]]

And you can hear the frog-dude coming, except he doesn&#39;t sound like he&#39;s running like you. 

He&#39;s hopping. //CRUNCH. CRUNCH. CRUNCH.// Closer and closer... 
Holy shit he IS a frog. He&#39;s like a big freaking humanoid frog or something! 

&quot;Gonna be GOOD EATIN&#39; tonight!&quot; he cackles, thumping closer and closer with his hops. 

Up ahead is the T-junction of the path you stopped at earlier. 
If you keep running, you&#39;ll leave the path and enter the dark treeline, and you&#39;re not sure that&#39;s where you want to be on this island... 

But if you turn **right** you&#39;ll still be heading deeper into the island, further north. Away from the house. 
**Left** obviously leads back to the mansion, which MIGHT still be locked, who knows what the fuck the ghosts are up to in there. 

You&#39;ve got seconds to decide where to run! 

[[Go right, deeper into the island!-&gt;FrogRun RightEnd]]

[[Keep going straight and try to hide in the darkness under the trees!-&gt;FrogRun HideSucc]]

</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="348" name="FrogRun Esc" tags="HF" position="807,3677" size="100,100">You dash off to the right and duck under the branches of the willow tree, disappearing into the leaves. 

There&#39;s a little candle burning at the base of the tree, and you don&#39;t want it giving away your position, so you head around behind the tree. There&#39;s a low branch you can climb up. You grip it tight, and look for another branch above. 
Soon you&#39;re about fifteen feet up. You climb up at least a few more feet and sit on a sturdy branch. You hear the frog go hopping past... but then you hear him come back, and you peek around the tree. 

He brushes the willow leaves aside. You can make his silhouette out in the candlelight; his skin is REALLY shiny. &quot;You came in HERE didncha. The candles in this shrine don&#39;t light up unless...&quot; 
The frog looks up, and sees you, and smiles. &quot;Unless someone&#39;s here.&quot; 

&quot;Look I don&#39;t want no TROUBLE!!&quot; you yell as he JUMPS and grabs the branch underneath your position with his webby, froggy fingers. 

&quot;... tarnation damn,&quot; he snaps, as he lets go and drops back to the ground. &quot;I can&#39;t be jumpin&#39; and climbin&#39; so high in my condition...&quot; 
Is he... what?? You look closer. He&#39;s cradling his stomach, which is, um, quite round. Like a beer gut, or... 
Are you //sure// he&#39;s a &#39;he&#39;? He SOUNDS like a &#39;he,&#39; but... 

&quot;I bet you&#39;ll come down once I got my shotgun though,&quot; the frog sneers up at you, and then hops back the way he came. 
Shotgun?? You better get the fuck outta here before he comes back with that shit! 
You climb down as quick as you can, dropping the last seven feet or so, and dash out of there. You run, and run, and run. You run across the path, past some little cabins, into the woods. 

You run until you see a small shack or hut or... shed. A little wooden shed, in a small clearing [[right in front of you.-&gt;Distillery FromHF]] </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="349" name="FrogRun RightEnd" tags="HF RG end" position="672,3949" size="100,100">You hang a right when the path splits and sprint into the darkness ahead-- 

and two bright gleaming eyes loom up in the darkness in front of you. 

&quot;Heh he heh heh heh... Hawhawhaw. Haw haw. How ya doin&#39; boy?&quot; the colossal black shape of the Rougarou sneers. He seems to have been hiding among the cluster of little wooden cabins off to the left. You turn tail and fucking MOVE. Between that huge beast and a frog-dude your size, you think your odds are better with the frog-- 

Except the frog&#39;s RIGHT THERE and he pounces straight into you. Before you even know what&#39;s happened, you&#39;ve done a faceplant //straight into his mouth!!// 

&quot;Mmmfff, GOAL!!&quot; the frog says in a muffled voice around your head. His tongue slides all around you then, in your shirt, in your pants, and you feel his hands on your ass, big slippery webbed hands, lifting you up and tipping you forwards into his mouth. 

You&#39;ve got nowhere else to go!! All you can see is the dark moist insides of the frog-dude&#39;s belly fast approaching your face as you enter his body. His long tongue stops you around the hips and lubes your crotch up, and as soon as you&#39;re horny enough, much to your chagrin, you can&#39;t help but grind into his tongue. Fuck!! 

You feel your pants slipping up and off as the frog&#39;s big webbed hands tug them loose. They come off easy, due to the slippery saliva he&#39;s slathered you with. And then... 

[[you slide inside-&gt;FrogRun RightEnd 2]] </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="350" name="FrogRun HideSucc" tags="HF" position="670,3824" size="100,100">You just keep running, straight off the path, into the bushes and trees. You go a few more feet, run around a big tree trunk, and hold very, very still. 

&quot;Where&#39;d you go, lil snack-boy!?&quot; you hear the frog calling out. &quot;I&#39;ve got PLENTY of room in here, don&#39;t be fooled by how small I is!!&quot; he drawls. 

You take a while to listen carefully and steady yourself. Your heart&#39;s pounding. You REALLY don&#39;t want to risk heading back onto the path now... now that there&#39;s potentially TWO creatures roaming the island who explicitly want you in their belly. 

Hmm. Your eyes are doing a decent job adjusting to the darkness here in the woods. You peer out from behind the tree. So... that&#39;s the path, and it&#39;s leading... up to the house... 

And you know the house&#39;s &quot;rear&quot; faces north. And you know that boathouse, which you have the key for! is to the north. Ssssooo. 

You know which direction north is, and you start moving through the woods. It&#39;s scary as fuck and every single branch looks like a scraggly black claw reaching for you. It&#39;s like that shit in //Snow White// where she&#39;s runnin&#39; through the forest trippin&#39; on acid. 

Suddenly there&#39;s no trees for a few feet, and... is that a shed?? 

[[What have you stumbled across?-&gt;Distillery FromHF]] </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="351" name="FrogRun LeftEnd" tags="HF badend" position="797,3951" size="100,100">You angle to the left and make a break for the mansion! The ornate stained-glass backdoor awaits you... 

you&#39;ve turned a right angle though, and there&#39;s no trees to block line-of-sight... you are within five feet of the porch stairs when the frog-dude //slams// into your back and pins you down. Gravel flies up onto the porch from the impact. You wince and claw at the ground to get away from him. 

&quot;Mmmm //ffuuuck// man, y&#39;all smell delicious.&quot; Slippery webbed hands clutch your wrists and pin your arms to your back like a cop performing an arrest. 

&quot;Lemme go bastard!&quot; you snap. You try to twist back and struggle to fight him, but he&#39;s surprisingly heavy, with a round, pot-bellied body that weighs on your back hard. 

&quot;Mmm. Mmmmmfff.&quot; He grunts as he shifts his weight to straddle your body, and a long slimy tongue descends to taste your face. &quot;Mmmf! Delicious. Good eatin&#39;s. Good, good eatin&#39;s. Here I was about to settle for fish &#39;n grubs again.&quot; 

You try to kick him as he reaches back and pulls your shoes off. Fuck! Fight harder he&#39;s gonna EAT YOU!! 

&quot;Don&#39;t need these,&quot; he chuckles. He tosses your shoes off somewhere, and then gets off you. 

[[KICK!!-&gt;FrogRun RearVore]] </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="352" name="FrogRun RearVore" tags="HF badend" position="803,4092" size="100,100">You lash out with both feet, and you try to push up off the ground. You feel his tongue wrap around one of your legs and you&#39;re jerked backwards along the path; your hands dig a pair of ruts into the gravel. If you can just land a proper kick!! 

Wait where&#39;d his tongue go is it UP YOUR PANT LEG?!? You shriek as you feel that slimy thing wriggle //straight// into your ass, and you hear him giggle as he licks your prostate. Your body goes rigid along with your boner, and you let out a terrified laugh. 

Mmm your feet are so warm and you&#39;re so horny. So. So. Horny. Fuck. Fuck. Fuck. Fuck. You make a little half-hearted attempt to pull away, but then you scoot backwards for some more of that TONGUE. 

It&#39;s just what he wants. He gathers your feet together, chuckling in triumph around his extended tongue, and slurps your legs into his mouth. His long arms reach out and his webbed hands clasp your torso to pick you up. 

Your world tilts back, then upwards, and you&#39;re looking at the sky above, sliding down into a nice warm fleshy pit. Being //massaged.// Mmm. His tongue slides out of you and wraps around your waist, and as you slide up to your navel in his wide frog-mouth, your dick grinds against his tongue a bit. And it&#39;s the last push you need to start cumming. 

He closes his lips around you and sucks you deeper. Then he laughs. &quot;Mmm. I love when a varmint bastes hisself. Mmm. C&#39;mere buddy. C&#39;mon in. Set a spell, heheh. Take a load off.&quot; 

You moan, and one of your arms reaches up at the last second, but you soon slide all the way down into the frog-man&#39;s belly, swelling him into a nice amphibious ball. You land on piles and piles of slippery little orb-shaped things, like, ohhh fuck they&#39;re like EGGs, and... what the fucking FUCK. 

You can feel his wide hands patting his gut, and the slow, plodding waddle back to his fishing pier. 
Soon you&#39;re swaying back and forth, compressed into the fetal position in his gut, twitching occasionally as you lose consciousness with all the pressure. 

**END** 

You are VITTLES for the Hillbilly Frog! 

You hear birds and crickets and frogs singing though, and you sit up in the grass, blinking in the morning sun. You&#39;re right where you were the night before... 

Except you&#39;re transparent, and colored a pale blue-white. 

You&#39;re a ghost. 
Furious, you rush away from the house, towards that path. Everything&#39;s much easier to figure out in the daylight. You hear a lot more frogs croaking and ribbeting as you draw close to the fishing pier with its little shack, and you&#39;re about to knock on the door when your hand goes through it. 

Well FINE then! You step through the door. &quot;You SON OF A BITCH you ATE ME--&quot; 

&quot;heheheh.&quot; The frog guy&#39;s arms and legs drape over the hammock he&#39;s laying in. Sheesh, he really is like... a big, human-sized frog with like a face and a straw-hat and a dirty little wife-beater shirt... &quot;I appreciate your sacrifice. You was a tasty meal, my man.&quot; 

And there&#39;s tiny frogs hopping all over the inside of the shack, like he fucking exploded. You look closer at him. He doesn&#39;t seem to have much of a pot-belly anymore, he just looks kinda... softer, thicker. He notices you staring and pats his tummy gratefully. &quot;Y&#39;all made me get a bit CHUNKY now, but. It&#39;s ok &#39;cuz you fed these babies good.&quot; 

&quot;I&#39;m...&quot; you can&#39;t bring yourself to say it. &quot;I&#39;m a fucking GHOST!!&quot; 

The frog-guy shrugs. &quot;Eh. It happens. Go find a voodoo queen, see if she can&#39;t fix you up with a new bod. Worked for me.&quot; 

You glare at him. &quot;I am gonna haunt the FUCK outta you.&quot; You turn invisible as you leave the shack and float off, your brain working overtime to process all this bullshit. 

//Well!// First things first. Time to figure out your new life-- er, UNlife-- as a ghost! Have fun! </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="353" name="FrogRun RightEnd 2" tags="RG HF end" position="543,3953" size="100,100">You&#39;re upside down, pressed into a ball inside the frog-guy&#39;s gut! You can feel him stretching to fit your mass; you imagine he looks like a big green ball with arms and legs from the outside, but you can feel him sink down to the ground and pat his belly and he moans happily. &quot;Mmm. Tasty vittles. You&#39;re too slow, Beau.&quot; 

&quot;Aww, BULLSHIT,&quot; growls the Rougarou. &quot;I&#39;m motherfuckin&#39; hungry nah! C&#39;mere.&quot; 

&quot;Bitch y&#39;all can&#39;t fit me an&#39; him inside you!&quot; the frog snaps, but suddenly he&#39;s being jostled all over and you can&#39;t right yourself. 

&quot;Shut your ass up,&quot; Beau grumbles. &quot;I&#39;mma stuff you right inside like a big... a big werewolf turducken, nah!! Haw haw.&quot; 

&quot;You crazy sumbitch!!&quot; the hillbilly frog spits out. 

You... feel even more squished. The frog&#39;s insides are hot, slimy, and he seems to have a bunch of little round... squishy things inside him. Like, something he ate? You can&#39;t be sure. And he must be sliding into Beau&#39;s throat, because he&#39;s making a major fuss outside, and you&#39;re being squeeeeeeeezed tightly in his belly... 
ugh. Gross. 

There&#39;s a muffled impact, but you&#39;re padded by the frog-dude. You can only guess Beau just flopped down in an overstuffed daze. &quot;FUCK,&quot; his gruff voice rumbles as he chuckles to himself. &quot;I ain&#39;t gonna hafta eat for a YEAR, haw haw...&quot; 

Well fucking SHIT BALLS. 
You&#39;re inside a frog-man, inside a werewolf. Looks like you&#39;re gonna be turned into Rougarou-bulk eventually! 

Except you feel yourself being worked around and you start to wriggle... upwards? Down? You can&#39;t tell but you&#39;re sliding around in the frog-man&#39;s belly, and... and you hear him belch?? 

Suddenly you flop up and outwards, feeling the frog-guy&#39;s lips passing around your body again. [[He gags and hacks and spits you out.-&gt;FrogRun RightEnd 3]]  </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="354" name="FrogRun RightEnd 3" tags="HF RG end" position="539,4096" size="100,100">You flop out of his mouth into Beau&#39;s belly, with not much more room to maneuver at all. You spend a bit of time righting yourself, ready to punch the fucker&#39;s lights out. 

&quot;Ok look, look now, y&#39;all,&quot; the frog mutters. &quot;Sorry &#39;bout that, it&#39;s just... look.&quot; 

&quot;You PRICK.&quot; You don&#39;t have enough room to wind-up properly but you at least get your message across with a little jab to his face. 

&quot;OWW! SORRY! Ok?? Ok ok. You&#39;re right, I deserved that,&quot; he snaps. &quot;Now calm your tits, yeah man? You wanna let him digest us and make the big fucker even bigger?&quot; 

&quot;... no.&quot; You nose-exhale, glowering at his wide frog-eyes. 

&quot;So listen,&quot; he says. &quot;If we wanna get outta here, we gotta fill him up good somehow. What&#39;ve you got?&quot; 

&quot;What have I GOT?&quot; you yell. &quot;NOTHING!&quot; 

It&#39;s true. Your clothes are gone... you think the frog may have dissolved them when he ate you. But you&#39;re not sure. Either way you&#39;re naked, and sitting in the hot soft belly of a werewolf, squished up against a frog dude. Fan. Fucking. Tastic. 

&quot;Then what&#39;s in here?&quot; he says, digging into something... are those your pants?? 

&quot;How the fuck--&quot; 

&quot;He ate your pants, ok? Tell me you got some shit-- YES. Is this what I think it is? Smells like one of &#39;Liza&#39;s potions...&quot; 

Is that... the vial? The uhh... that stuff you drank in the library?? 

[[Holy shit this might work.-&gt;FrogRun RightEnd 4]] </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="355" name="FrogRun RightEnd 4" tags="RG HF end" position="544,4216" size="100,100">&quot;That&#39;s... uhh... Eliza gave that to me, yeah,&quot; you say. 

&quot;And what&#39;s it do?&quot; the frog-guy asks. &quot;What happens if one of us drinks it? Do you end up lookin&#39; pregnant from it to fool that one dumbass ghost up there?&quot; 

&quot;... yeah, why? We gonna dump it out in Beau here?&quot; 

&quot;Naw, dummy, I actually AM pregnant... here feel,&quot; he says, and he grabs your right wrist and pulls your hand over to touch his rounded belly. 

Goodness. He&#39;s got... those were like EGGS in there. Weren&#39;t they? 

&quot;... so what&#39;s your plan?&quot; you ask. 

&quot;HEY QUIT your thrashin&#39; around in there lil snacks,&quot; Beau hollers outside. 

&quot;Shut your hairy-ass up!&quot; the frog snaps back. Then he throws the potion down his own throat. &quot;Ok, get ready for it to get REAL tight in here... and you&#39;re gonna help me get my eggs out, ok?&quot; 

&quot;Your... what the FUCK is even going on in my life tonight??&quot; you murmur, but you brace yourself and watch as the frog-dude starts to balloon outwards towards you. 

&quot;Urp... shshhhhiiit, glad that was only a half-dose,&quot; he grunts as his tummy rapidly pulses bigger and bigger. &quot;Mmff! Mm. Fuck. Fucker. Fuck. Bitch tits. Tarnation motherfucker...! Ok. Ok. So my eggs gonna absorb all that, in just a second here, and...&quot; 

He shivers and before you even realize what happened, you see a glistening round ball slip out from between his legs. It&#39;s probably the size of a kid-sized bowling ball. &quot;Hot damn,&quot; he pants. &quot;I shouldn&#39;t-a done that, egg-slit&#39;s gonna be wide sloppy-open for a week now, but... fuck it.&quot; 

[[What. Is. Your. Life.-&gt;FrogRun RightEnd 5]] </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="356" name="FrogRun RightEnd 5" tags="HF RG end" position="678,4206" size="100,100">&quot;Help me push &#39;em out!!&quot; the frog guy grunts and shudders as he squeezes out another egg. 

&quot;FUcking HOW??&quot; you yelp as the egg shoots out and smacks into your chest. 

&quot;Get up and PUSH!!&quot; he whines. His floppy webbed feet are slapping around Beau&#39;s belly, all around you. &quot;Mmmfff... nnfff... I have GOT to stop fertilizin&#39; myself...&quot; 

You let out the world&#39;s most dramatically put-out sigh and try to stand up a little, so you can lean on his gut and press down with all your weight. 

&quot;Ooohhhh c&#39;mon c&#39;mon c&#39;mon... YYEYEESSSSYESYSEYSEYSEYEYEYSEEssssss...&quot; the frog-dude dissolves as a veritable GUSH of eggs slides out of him, one after the other, like... like a flow of big round slippery balls. There seems to be much more inside him than you would have guessed. 

&quot;Hey what are y&#39;all doin&#39; in there-- Hoo SHIT!!&quot; you hear Beau cry out. He must be growing immensely round by now. Well, rounder than before, what with two human-sized meals inside him. 

You flop backwards onto the growing pile of eggs. They&#39;re incredibly soft and so slippery you&#39;re actually sinking into them, like a ball-put. They actually feel kinda good. Like massage beads... 

&quot;Ugghhh... fuck, I gotta get y&#39;all outta here!!&quot; Beau yells, and his entire body starts to heave around you both. 

&quot;Hell yeah! It worked!&quot; the frog-man says. He reaches over and shakes your hand, but then the world tilts up and down, and you&#39;re smashed against him, and all the eggs are rolling everywhere and you feel him slide away... 

You flop back and FUCK there&#39;s eggs everywhere, in your armpits, under your feet, your back, one of them&#39;s wedged right in your asscrack-- 

[[Your eyes go wide as it //SCHLOOP//s right into your butt.-&gt;FrogRun RightEnd final]] </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="357" name="FrogRun RightEnd final" tags="HF RG end" position="675,4078" size="100,100">When you feel the egg slip inside, you clap your hand to your mouth to cover a sQUEAL of shock, but then you, too, are forced up-- or backwards? you can&#39;t even tell which way is which in here. 

Your shoulders hit gravel and you hear crickets again, and see moonlight above you. You lay there dazed for a sec, but then you prop yourself up on your elbows and look around. 

There&#39;s uhh, Mr. Frog or whatever, spread-eagled and grinning at the sight of his empty belly. And um. There&#39;s the big werewolf. Beau is groaning, sobbing even, as his huge werewolf hands rub his egg-stuffed gut. It pokes up into the air above his body like a slightly-lumpy beanbag chair. 

&quot;You. You lil bastards,&quot; Beau mumbles. 

&quot;Ok. So... I think we&#39;ve all learned something tonight,&quot; the frog-guy chuckles. 

&quot;Fuck. You guys.&quot; You groan at the weird, pitted-feeling in your own bowels, and the slippery goo seeping from your asshole... and you black out. 

**END** 

When you wake up, you&#39;re in the frog-dude&#39;s hammock. Laying on the floor next to you is Beau, in his human form. Very, VERY pregnant-looking. He&#39;s out cold. 

The shack door opens and the frog dude steps in. He lifts up your jeans. &quot;Good thing I took these off you first, heheh.&quot; He tosses them to you. 

You sit up and start to pull them on, and, uhh. You can&#39;t button them. 
Your tummy is just a bit... swollen. 

&quot;No hard feelings, my dude,&quot; the Frog says. He grins and reaches over to pat your gut. &quot;I&#39;ll let you keep this one as a, um. Gesture of appreciation.&quot; 

&quot;I. Don&#39;t. Want. It.&quot; 

&quot;Aww shucks, well...&quot; he chuckles. &quot;Not much I can do to get it out now. Yer gonna have to let her grow to full size.&quot; 

Your eyes get huge. &quot;You mean it&#39;s going to get BIGGER??&quot; 

&quot;Weelll //sure,//&quot; he says. The Frog ruffles your hair. &quot;But hey, since Beau&#39;s uhh, what they call it? Indisposed? I can get you back across the swamp, I know the way.&quot; 

The Frog grabs Beau&#39;s airboat keys from his pocket and leads you back to the boathouse. About a half-hour later (he gets lost for a few minutes), you&#39;re back at your car, and driving home, ready to put this entire mess behind you. 

Except you&#39;re PREGNANT with a FROG EGG and you&#39;re gonna have to deal with that, aren&#39;t you? 
What are you subscribers gonna say?? 
Maybe you can pass it off as... a beer belly or something. 

Good luck! </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="358" name="FrogChat Help" tags="HF" position="1080,3941" size="100,100">&quot;Hey wait, uhh... do you think you could help me out?&quot; you ask. 

Joe glances back at you, frowning. &quot;... with what?&quot; 

&quot;Well how about the //werewolf// for starters??&quot; 

&quot;Pssh!&quot; Joe waves a web-fingered hand at you. &quot;Whatchu want me to do, fight him? Hell nah. Hey, you&#39;re bigger than me anyway, if he&#39;s hungry he&#39;ll go for you first, hahahah. Now lemme alone, I got fish to catch.&quot; 

Well THAT was probably a dismissal, but... you could persist, if you wanted. 

[[Nah, leave.-&gt;FrogChat Leave]] 

[[&quot;Aren&#39;t you worried about him though?&quot;-&gt;FrogChat Werewolf]] 

You could still [[follow him onto the pier,-&gt;FrogChat Chill]] and have a seat if you wanna hang with him for a minute. </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="359" name="FrogChat Chill" tags="HF" position="1218,3936" size="100,100">You get the sense that you&#39;ll have to treat him a little differently than you would most people; he seems kinda like a hermmit. You can&#39;t tell his age though. He&#39;s either, younger than you expect, or he&#39;s just not got a deeper voice &#39;cuz he&#39;s a frog-guy, or... maybe he&#39;s... hmm. 
He&#39;s just androgynous, really. You can see between his legs, no doubt about that, and there&#39;s not a dick or balls there. It looks like a weird little, um, slit-shape?  
But... don&#39;t male and female frogs...?

you have no idea how it works, and you can&#39;t access the Internet to figure it out right now. But you&#39;re PRETTY sure, at the very least, male frogs and amphibians in general don&#39;t have dicks. 

Regardless, you follow Joe out to the pier and cop a squat next to him. He&#39;s got a long spear, split at the end like a fork. He watches the water intently. 

How do you proceed? 

[[&quot;So, uhh... you like to spearfish?&quot;-&gt;FrogChat Fishing]] 

[[&quot;... how &#39;come you&#39;re a like a frog-guy?&quot;-&gt;FrogChat Why]] 

[[&quot;So what do you use for bait around here?&quot;-&gt;FrogChat Bait]] 

[[&quot;...&quot; (just kinda sit there quietly)-&gt;FrogChat Hush]] 

</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="360" name="FrogChat Leave" tags="HF" position="953,3950" size="100,100">Your shoulders slump; something about his attitude is just a bit off-putting. Perhaps you were just hoping for some friendliness after all the fear and tension you&#39;ve been dealing with all night. &quot;Well, uhh... I guess, have a nice evening?&quot; you mutter. 

&quot;Ehh.&quot; Joe doesn&#39;t look back at you. &quot;Good luck.&quot; 

And with that, you&#39;ve got not much left to do, other than to head back the way you came. 

You follow the gravel path back. Soon you&#39;re back at the intersection. 

Off to the left, the mansion. You&#39;ve got no reason to head back in there-- your phone battery&#39;s dead anyway. There&#39;s monsters and stuff roaming the place... it&#39;s definitely time to leave. You&#39;re not sure you&#39;d last until morning, trying to hole up in the house. It&#39;s not much better out here but at least it&#39;s SOMETHING. 

So you&#39;re gonna follow the path to the right. Heading north. For a moment it occurs to you that finding that secret boathouse in the letter, might, umm... might be easier if you stuck to the shoreline. 
Except that&#39;s a REALLY STUPID fucking idea, right? Walking along the shores of an alligator-infested swamp, in the middle of the night. 

[[You head down the path to the right.-&gt;RearNorth Hub]] </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="361" name="Distillery FromHF" tags="DIST" position="729,3126" size="100,100">It&#39;s a squat little building, decrepit and slightly-rotten looking. Like someone&#39;s shed that their great-grandpa built and they don&#39;t go in anymore and there&#39;s probably a family of opossums living inside. You don&#39;t see any lights inside... looks like no one&#39;s home. 

You don&#39;t //really// wanna go in here, but you definitely need a moment to gather yourself back together, calm down, take a breather and all. As long as nothing crazy&#39;s in here, you should just... have a minute, right? 

[[You push the creaky old door open and step in.-&gt;Distillery]] </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="362" name="Distillery" tags="DIST" position="344,3000" size="100,100">You push open the creaky door, and step into the darkness. 
FFFFUCK it&#39;s dark in here! 
It&#39;s even darker than the woods outside, and that&#39;s some DARK shit. You wish there was like a lightswitch or something to... 

Is that a lantern? 
You reach over and your hand touches something //plastic.// That. That is a //flashlight.// 

You turn it on and scan the building. 

It takes you a moment to understand what you&#39;re looking at. It&#39;s a big... ugly, metal contraption with tubes and coils and a gauge and a big tank and... it&#39;s a //whiskey still.// There&#39;s some empty jugs laying around, stacked on a shelf nearby. 
The flooring is... well, there isn&#39;t really a floor. It&#39;s just dirt. 
One dusty, opaque window. 
Looks like there&#39;s a desk, and a few bottles, and some of them even have some shine left inside, like for real. 

Or... is that shine? Some of them look almost like some of the stuff Eliza had up in her little witchcraft alchemy-lab room or whatever that was. And there&#39;s some papers here too, kinda like her library... does this still belong to her? 

The fucking flashlight blinks out. You smack it, getting it to flick back on dimly. The batteries are almost dead. You probably won&#39;t have enough juice to spend very much time in here at all, and there will be no point in taking it with you. It&#39;s just a cheap dollar-store light anyway. 

Well, what do you check out first? 

[[Inspect the still.-&gt;Moonshine Still]] Could it still be operable? 

[[Check the desk.-&gt;Distillery Desk]] 

[[Look at the bottles.-&gt;Distillery Bottles]] 

[[Actually... leave.-&gt;Distillery Leave to Path]] </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="363" name="DevilRG TransformEnd2" tags="TD RG end" position="1932,3981" size="100,100">&quot;Arrgghh, Starr!! You bastard--!!&quot; you&#39;re having trouble expressing words, as you feel your face shifting and pushing outwards. &quot;You said... You didn&#39;t say... you FUCKER!!&quot; 

&quot;What I //said,// was, &#39;I guarantee you the werewolf on this island will stop trying to eat you.&#39;&quot; Starr chuckles like a jester. &quot;I did NOT say that you, yourself, //wouldn&#39;t// also turn into a rougarou. Heheh. Silly mortal.&quot; 

Your furious eyes lock onto him and you charge forward, but it&#39;s ineffectual as you don&#39;t have full control of your changing limbs and body... and Starr just smirks. &quot;You know, I think you&#39;ll be good at it though. I think you&#39;ll like being a werewolf. Toodle-ooo!&quot; he says with a wave. 

Huge black and purple wings appear behind him, opening into a 20 foot span, and flap once, rocketing him skywards. You glare up at him as he vanishes in a cloud of demonic smoke, but you&#39;re forced to hunch over again as your back and chest engorge with fresh power. You feel your shirt splitting off you, and your jeans bursting like sausage casing as your legs grow too thick. 

You&#39;re a BIG beast now, and you&#39;ve got proper nightvision, which is great, because the dark is hardly dark anymore and really puts into perspective how bad it would have been, trying to hide out here from Beau&#39;s gaze. 
It also lets you see your shotgun-sized new manhood flop out and sway like a flail ready to attack. Hot damn, that sucker&#39;s HUGE. You grin at no one, baring your fangs. Wow. WOW look at those BALLS. There is. SO much cum in there. 

You tilt your head back and sniff the air. You smell some things. 
You run fast. You find some things. 

**END** 

You have been turned into a ROUGAROU!! 

Your hulking new frame lopes through the night as a grim dark shape, pounding along the pathway around the mansion, hungry and horny and needy. You stop to scent the air every so often. You quickly locate the OTHER werewolf on the island, Beau, somewhere behind the house lurking in a collection of small cabins. 

Your attack comes so quickly, and your presence is so unexpected, that Beau is pinned to the ground in spite of his greater size and experience. You mount him before he can gather his wits back together and //impregnate// the much larger werewolf, the pair of you shivering and twitching as you hump and hump and hump and //unload.// 

And then, together, you both turn back into humans. 

Beau scrambles away from you. &quot;What. The. FUCK??&quot; 

&quot;Uhh...&quot; you rub the back of your neck and blush. &quot;Sssooo... there was this dude, in the graveyard, I think he was a demon or something...&quot; 

You tell Beau the long story, and to make the long story short, though he&#39;s rather embarrassed at you getting the better of him like this... he takes it in stride. He shows you a small, cozy little cabin of his own, well-furnished, almost //modern// by current standards, and gives you some clothes, and... 

You get to watch him bloating up with your pup. Heheh. Fast-acting, hmm. Within an hour of being seeded, Beau looks two months along. How the HELL ASS does it work on guys too? Oh well. At least it&#39;s not you, right? Heheh. 

The two of you spend awhile in conversation as Beau teaches you the basics of living as a lycanthrope. In the morning he takes you back across the swamp to your car, and you drive back into the city, ready to start your new life as a horny shapeshifting monster. </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="364" name="FrogChat Fishing" tags="HF" position="1091,4082" size="100,100">&quot;If I wasn&#39;t carryin&#39; a load of EGGS right now,&quot; Joe says, &quot;I&#39;d be in there swimmin&#39; and catchin&#39; the fish that way.

The fuck? 
How do you respond to that? 

[[&quot;You&#39;re pregnant?&quot;-&gt;FrogChat Pregnant]] 

[[&quot;Hmm. So uhh, why are you like. A frog?&quot;-&gt;FrogChat Why]]  

[[Don&#39;t say anything else,-&gt;FrogChat Hush]] just process what you just heard.

We found a nice stash of strong-ass whiskey, uhh... So I got fucked up, uhh... little too drunk. Fell in the swamp. Big gator ended up eatin&#39; me, but like, I came back as a ghost? And I guess I wasn&#39;t ready to go yet...&quot; 

He licks his lips as he stares into the bayou. &quot;So, made a deal with lil Miss Voodoo up in there,&quot; he says, jabbing a thumb in the direction of the mansion. &quot;She fixed me back up with a proper body, but... not human. So. Word to the wise, be careful whose booze you poach around here.&quot; 

That&#39;s really vague. 

Do you ask him about anything else? 

[[&quot;So... do you //like// being a frog though?&quot;-&gt;FrogChat Like It]] 

[[&quot;So how &#39;come you&#39;re spearfishing instead of using a pole?&quot;-&gt;FrogChat Fishing]] 

[[Just keep quiet.-&gt;FrogChat Hush]] </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="366" name="FrogChat Bait" tags="HF" position="1363,4099" size="100,100">&quot;I&#39;m spearfishin&#39; ya dummy!&quot; Joe snorts. He holds his spear up to show you. &quot;Ain&#39;t usin&#39; no bait, just watchin&#39; for the closest fish!&quot; 

He rubs his chin for a second. &quot;Actually... hold up a second. Do I have...&quot; 
He reaches over to the end of the pier and picks up a bucket. &quot;Shit, I DO have a couple! Only need about one though.&quot; 

His long frog tongue shoots down into the bucket and sucks something up into his mouth, which he gulps down quick. &quot;Mm. Good for snacks, too. Protein-rich.&quot; He reaches in the bucket with his hand and pulls another, uhh, whatever-they-are out, tossing it in the water. &quot;Here we go. This&#39;ll bring the fish around.&quot; 

You didn&#39;t really see what he&#39;s using for bait though... 
Ask him? 

[[&quot;What are they?-&gt;FrogChat WormBelly]] 

[[Nah, keep quiet and see if it attracts some fish for him.-&gt;FrogChat Hush]] </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="367" name="FrogChat Hush" tags="HF" position="955,4212" size="100,100">You keep quiet. 

Joe sighs and smacks his lips around the reed in his mouth. He turns his head a lot as he watches the water. His big frog eyes don&#39;t seem to be capable of moving in their sockets. 

He jerks his head slightly at a splash, way out in the bayou. &quot;Ehh.&quot; 

You nod. &quot;Mmm.&quot; Looks like an alligator just caught something. 

It&#39;s definitely hard to see anything in the black water, but you&#39;re absolutely sure something just moved by that lilypad, between you and Joe&#39;s positions. You &quot;mm?&quot; and point down at it. 

Joe&#39;s head swivels. His eyes get big. Quickly he stabs the spear into the water and brings up a BIG catfish. &quot;Hot DAMN son, how&#39;d you see that??&quot; 

&quot;Just... noticed, I guess.&quot; 

Joe laughs and puts the entire fish in his mouth, using the spear as a big fork. He tips his head back, gulps, gulps again, and you watch the wiggling bulge slide down his throat. His round tummy puffs up slightly bigger and jostles around a bit. He puts the spear down and leans back on his hands. 

&quot;Mmmm. That was. Best fish all week. Mmm.&quot; Joe lets out a long, loud BURP. &quot;Thanks a bunch.&quot; 

&quot;No prob.&quot; 

&quot;I was about to use the pirogue up that way,&quot; he points off to the left... which you&#39;re pretty sure is **NORTH**. &quot;If I couldn&#39;t catch anything here. Normally I swim, but... I just don&#39;t feel like wrasslin&#39; with gators with all these eggs weighin&#39; me down.&quot; His webbed fingers splay over his belly and he smiles a happy smile. 

&quot;What&#39;s a... pee-rogue?&quot; you ask. 

&quot;Little boat. Flat-bottom. Gotta push it along the swamp with a pole,&quot; Joe says. &quot;You can check it out if you want. If you head north from here, past the burnt trees, you should see a boathouse all over-grown n&#39; shit. If you hit the bubbly swamp-gas pits though, you&#39;ve gone too far.&quot; 

You file that away for later; //Joe just told you where the secret boathouse is.// &quot;... thanks dude.&quot; 

&quot;No problemo, amigo,&quot; he says with a chuckle. His tummy gurgles as he digests his fish. &quot;Thanks for dinner.&quot; 

&quot;... see you around,&quot; you say, getting up to leave. 

&quot;Likewise man. Hey don&#39;t let Beau push you around, yeah?&quot; he calls after you. 

[[You head back to the main path.-&gt;RearNorth Hub]] The mansion is to the left, or **SOUTH,** but that&#39;s not where the boathouse is, is it? </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="368" name="FrogChat Like It" tags="HF" position="1233,4224" size="100,100">Joe frowns and presses his lips together. &quot;Dog, I&#39;m tryna catch fish here...&quot; 

&quot;Sorry.&quot; 

&quot;... I mean, it&#39;s ok.&quot; He focuses on the water. &quot;I can jump real good and swim real fast. Hold my breath a long time for swimmin&#39; and whatnot. And the tongue is cool, it&#39;s like an extra long arm for grabbin&#39; shit. But...&quot; he blows a long breath through his nose. 

And he kinda smirks at you, almost sheepish. &quot;Thing is, I keep gettin&#39; pregnant.&quot; 

Your eyes get big and you can&#39;t help but stare at him. 

[[&quot;Uhh... //pregnant//?-&gt;FrogChat Pregnant]] </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="369" name="FrogChat Werewolf" tags="HF" position="953,4085" size="100,100">&quot;Fuck no, I ain&#39;t afraid of his fluffy-ass,&quot; Joe chuckles. &quot;If he comes at me, I just take a swim.&quot; 

&quot;He can&#39;t swim?&quot; 

&quot;Well he won&#39;t go in the water &#39;cuz of all the gators, man!&quot; Joe laughs. &quot;I&#39;m sure he can swim, but not faster than a gator. Not like I can. Plus I can jump way better than him, so even if there&#39;s no water to swim in, what&#39;s he gonna do? I just find a nice high spot to jump up in, like on top of a house or a tree. Beau knows he can&#39;t have me. I bet I taste gross anyway, and also...&quot; 

He grins and pats his round stomach. &quot;I&#39;m like already carrying something in here, so I&#39;m useless to him for fuckin,&#39; too.&quot; 

You stare at his belly. You&#39;re still staring as he shrugs and walks over to the pier, sitting down and picking up a fishing spear. 

He&#39;s, umm. Pregnant? 

Maybe he&#39;ll tell you about it, if you&#39;re curious and head over to [[have a seat with him.-&gt;FrogChat Chill]] 

Or [[you could just leave,-&gt;FrogChat Leave]] that works too. </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="370" name="FrogChat WormBelly" tags="HF badend" position="1370,4222" size="100,100">Joe rolls his eyes and reaches in the bucket. &quot;Here look.&quot; 

In his hand is a fucking fat, wriggly larva-grub-thing about the size of a can of pop. Before you really get a good look at it though, Joe reaches over and puts his arm around your shoulders, pulls you close, and 

PUSHES THE GRUB INTO YOUR MOUTH

You gag and try to squirm away but Joe gives you a thump on the back and a little shake and tilts your chin up, and you feel the big larva go slithering down your throat. It plops into your gut like a rock. 

&quot;There. Now hush your mouth up so I can catch me some dinner.&quot; And with that, Joe picks his spear back up and resumes watching the swamp. 

You just sit there, cringing, staring down at your stomach. You can feel the wormy little critter crawling around in your guts. You can SEE it pushing against your skin on occasion. 

Meanwhile, Joe stabs the water and comes up with an impaled fish. &quot;Haha! Nice, man, nice.&quot; He swallows it whole, right off the spear as easily and naturally as you would with a regular kitchen fork. 

Uggghhh grossssss you&#39;re feeling all sickly with that worm inside. Your head spins. It feels like. Like something&#39;s being //squirted// into you. Uggh. Nnngg. You flop back on the pier, clutching your abdomen. 

&quot;Uh oh. Heh.&quot; Joe chuckles as he peeks over at you. &quot;Must not do so well in a human belleh, huh?&quot; 

&quot;Dude get it OUT!!&quot; you gasp. Fuck, what&#39;s it doing, why&#39;s it... Ugghghhh why is your stomach bulging upwards??? Is it growing or something?!?

Joe&#39;s eyes widen. &quot;Uh oh. Uh oh! That one... I bet that one was fertilized!! Hehehe. Haha! You unlucky bastard.&quot; 

You whimper and grit your teeth as your belly continues to puff up and rise like a baking bun. &quot;Get. It. Out!!&quot; 

&quot;I can&#39;t, dog! You gonna hafta let it finish its business!&quot; he chuckles. He reaches over and pats your swelling belly. &quot;Looks like you&#39;re gonna have a belly fulla eggs, too. Just like me! &#39;Cept, yours... I can use as more bait to catch more fish...&quot; 

He stares down at you with a look of discovery and wonder on his face. &quot;That&#39;s... that&#39;s a GOOD IDEA now... I wonder why I didn&#39;t think of that before.&quot; 

&quot;What??&quot; you moan. 

Joe stands up and lifts you in his arms. He&#39;s surprisingly strong despite being smaller than you, and... a frog. He carries you into his shack, whistling aimlessly. 

Your cheeks puff out as gooey, silky whiteness churns up from your belly to gush out of your mouth. Something is VERY wrong with you. You&#39;re packed full and your skin is tight and you can barely breathe and your abdomen is looking //immense...// 

**END** 

You are now a NEST for swamp grubs! 

Joe puts you in his little shack, in his hammock, to pass out and continue swelling. You only wake up when the hammock BREAKS under your weight some time later, and you are truly terrified when you see the octo-mom-sized belly that has taken over your body. 

&quot;Hot fuckin&#39; damn, dog, you gonna give me more bait than I know what to do with!&quot; Joe says as he returns to the shack in the morning with some supplies in his arms. &quot;I&#39;m gonna hafta open up a bait shop or something!!&quot; 

You shiver and gurgle up a few sloppy dribbles of silky white goo. You can&#39;t even speak. You can only lay there on the floor, a ball with useless limbs, feeling all the grubs i
nside crawl around and inspect their new home. 

Looks like you&#39;re gonna be stuck like this for awhile... </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="371" name="FrogChat Pregnant" tags="HF" position="1095,4222" size="100,100">&quot;Yyyeah, kinda,&quot; Joe sighs. He leans back a bit, showing off the curve of his bulging tummy. &quot;Basically, uhh... I mean frogs got different parts than we do, and...&quot; he puts his spear down and laughs a little, hiding his face in his hands for a minute. &quot;Can&#39;t believe I gotta explain my own birds &#39;n bees... ok look.

&quot;You &#39;member //Jurassic Park//?&quot; he says. 

&quot;Yeah.&quot; 

&quot;So &#39;member when they said that uhh, if they all the same sex, some of them can change gender &#39;cuz they put frog DNA in the dinos?&quot; 

You stare at him as you start to understand. &quot;Sooo...&quot; 

&quot;So BASICALLY,&quot; Joe says slowly, &quot;I&#39;m a dude, and I was a dude before I turned all froggy, but... since I&#39;m the only one of me around, and... I mean... I kinda like, uhh... self-fertilize. Sorta.&quot; 

&quot;Self-fertilize.&quot; 

&quot;Yeah, I got the proper male frog parts, but I also kinda... have like. A womb. I guess a //man-womb// you might say. Heheh.&quot; If he were still mammalian, he&#39;d probably be blushing, but the coy grin on his face is enough to get the point across. 

How do you respond? 

[[&quot;Huh. Sucks to be you I guess.-&gt;FrogChat Oviposition]] 

[[&quot;...&quot; (just nod and fall silent)-&gt;FrogChat Hush]] 

[[&quot;So you lay eggs then?&quot;-&gt;FrogChat Oviposition]] </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="372" name="FrogChat Oviposition" tags="HF" position="1096,4344" size="100,100">&quot;Yyyyyep, pretty much!&quot; Joe says. 

He watches the water for a bit longer, but then eyes you sideways, and starts rubbing his chin. For a moment he VERY closely resembles a certain infamous Internet meme... 

&quot;Say, hoss... how &#39;bout I make you a deal.&quot; 

&quot;... what&#39;d you have in mind?&quot; you ask. 

&quot;Well, you wanna get outta here, right?&quot; he asks. &quot;And since Beau&#39;s out there lookin&#39; to fuck you up, you can&#39;t exactly take his airboat. Right?&quot; 

&quot;... right?&quot; 

&quot;Well. I could get you outta here on a //different// boat. But I need you to help me out. Gotta lay these eggs in a safe place.&quot; His slippery hand drums on the tight, shiny skin of his gut. 

&quot;A different boat?&quot; you ask. 

&quot;Yeah man. Little flat-bottomed boat. It ain&#39;t far. I&#39;ll take you outta here and Beau will be none the wiser, //I guarantee!//&quot; Joe chuckles as he mimics Beau&#39;s more Cajun accent. &quot;You won&#39;t have to worry about werewolves or alligators or anything else. I&#39;ll getcha home safe. Or at least back across the swamp to civilization.&quot; 

&quot;So whaddaya say?&quot; and he holds a hand out. 

Well... how curious are you to watch a frog-man squeezing eggs out his little, um, frog-man... egg-laying slit? 

[[&quot;Ok, deal.&quot; You shake his hand.-&gt;Frog Egg Ending]] 

[[&quot;... nah, I&#39;d rather not bro.-&gt;FrogChat LeaveAlt]] </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="373" name="Frog Egg Ending" tags="end HF" position="1231,4344" size="100,100">&quot;I... ok, so, you want me to help... with your eggs, huh?&quot; you say, very uncertain about the whole thing. &quot;What exactly do I do?&quot; 

You figure he needs you to like, help support him while he lays his clutch, or help squeeze them out, or bring him something to drink. 

You are NOT expecting him to launch himself at you, pinning you down on the pier and straddling your chest. &quot;Hot motherfuckin&#39; DAMN son, you ain&#39;t gotta do much at all.&quot; He shifts his weight up closer to your neck. &quot;Just relax and hold still and open wiiiiiddde!!&quot; 

&quot;Hey wait wha--MMFFMF!!!&quot; 

Everything goes dark n&#39; squishy as Joe sits on your face. The FUCK?? He wriggles and clamps your head firmly between his thighs. &quot;C&#39;mon man, get your tongue up in there for me...&quot; he mumbles. &quot;Mmm that&#39;s it dog.&quot; 

He&#39;s like, pulling your head into his crotch, and his weird little genital slit is opening up around your mouth-- and you&#39;re running out of breath, and you can&#39;t help but gasp for air, which is exatly what he wants. His slit puffs up and bulges around the sides, and you feel Joe shiver a little as a soft slick ball drops into your mouth. 

&quot;Nnnggg... yeah, just gulp that down for me,&quot; he says, and you feel another egg drop into your mouth and push the first to the back of your throat. You can barely breathe and you&#39;re gagging, and then the first egg compresses and slides down your throat. Your hands are smacking at his thighs, but... he&#39;s a frog, and his legs are very, very strong. 

Another egg slides into your mouth from his slit, pushing the second down your throat as well. You are powerless to stop Joe&#39;s eggs from rolling down into your belly, one by one. Your arms go limp eventually and you just lay there and take it. He&#39;s too heavy, too strong, and has you pinned. You&#39;ve got no leverage. You can feel your lower body getting fuller and fuller... 

Finally, Joe gets off you, rolling backwards and standing up. You blink and take a moment to catch your breath. Then you look up at him, horrified. 

&quot;Ehh don&#39;t worry, you&#39;ll be alright. I really appreciate it, too!&quot; he says, looking a lot lighter and slimmer now that he&#39;s empty of egg content. 

And you don&#39;t want to look down at your own gut, but you have to. It&#39;s as round and bloated as you would imagine. A little lumpy here and there, but even as you wince from the sight, things sort of shift around properly and settle in to give you a nice smooth pregnant look. 

Joe holds a hand out to help you up. &quot;Alrighty man, just like I promised, I&#39;mma get you outta here. Follow me to the boat!&quot; 

**END** 

You have been STUFFED full of FROG EGGS! 

Your belly is packed tightly with the round, squishy, super-slick eggs. Each is about the size of a softball, you&#39;d imagine. They&#39;re firm, but can squish to fit into various places, like your throat of course... And all your nooks &#39;n crannies inside. 

Joe paddles you back across the swamp by leaning over the back of the boat and kicking with his feet-- apparently it&#39;s faster than using the pole. &quot;So you&#39;re just gonna let those grow for a few days or weeks or however long, and when you&#39;re ready to birth, just head for a bathtub and turn on the water and let &#39;em loose! They&#39;ll fend for themselves once they&#39;re out.&quot; 

&quot;How. Do I get. Them out.&quot; 

&quot;Eh. Probably the same way they got in,&quot; he shrugs, as he lazily steers the little flat-bottomed boat to the dock ahead. You can see your car waiting for you. &quot;A few might come out the other way, just let &#39;em, don&#39;t try to fight it. Welp, here we are my man!&quot; 

He helps you climb out of the boat and get back on dry land. FUCK you&#39;re a lot heavier now. You get in your car, barely listening as he bids you goodbye and heads back to the water. 

Your FUCKING GUT is pressing against the steering wheel like the fat girl from //Norbit//. SonnuvaBITCH. The eggs squish inside you and squelch and make you cringe from the noises they&#39;re making. 

You drive away carefully. Back at your apartment you have to get used to carrying around a big belly full of eggs. Bending over is hard, cooking is hard, doing ANYTHING is hard really. Even showering. Fuck, PEEING is hard &#39;cuz you can barely even reach your dick to aim... 

Hey, at least it&#39;s only for like... a week he said? 
... a whole week to get even bigger than the almost third-trimester-looking bulge sticking out of your body. Ugh. Dammit. 

Maybe you can pass it off as a beer gut or an allergic reaction or something. Maybe, tell your subscribers you&#39;re sick and won&#39;t be making the video for the next few weeks or however long it takes. 

Aww, perk up! It&#39;s not every day you get a bunch of big squishy frog eggs laid in your body! </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="374" name="FrogChat LeaveAlt" tags="HF" position="964,4342" size="100,100">Joe&#39;s shoulders slump and he shrugs. &quot;Well alright. Suit yourself.&quot; He returns his attention to the water, raising his spear and watching for bubbles or fins. 

&quot;I&#39;ll just head off then,&quot; you mutter. &quot;Nice meeting you, good luck with the fish!&quot; 

&quot;Yep, Yep,&quot; Joe says, not looking at you. &quot;Good luck with the werewolf! And all the ghosts...&quot; 

And with that, you leave the pier. You follow the gravel path back. Soon you&#39;re back at the intersection. 

Off to the left, the mansion. You&#39;ve got no reason to head back in there-- your phone battery&#39;s dead anyway. There&#39;s monsters and stuff roaming the place... it&#39;s definitely time to leave. You&#39;re not sure you&#39;d last until morning, trying to hole up in the house. It&#39;s not much better out here but at least it&#39;s SOMETHING. 

So you&#39;re gonna follow the path to the right. Heading north. For a moment it occurs to you that finding that secret boathouse in the letter, might, umm... might be easier if you stuck to the shoreline. 
Except that&#39;s a REALLY STUPID fucking idea, right? Walking along the shores of an alligator-infested swamp, in the middle of the night. 

[[You head down the path to the right.-&gt;RearNorth Hub]] </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="375" name="RearNorth Hub2" tags="" position="905,2626" size="100,100">You keep walking, past the slave cabins. You&#39;re deep in the treeline now, with only the path directing you forward. You just gotta keep following it. 

You&#39;re having a hard time reasoning it out; where the secret boathouse might be. Obviously to the north of the house, and obviously on the water, but in which direction? Will the path take you there? How would the place stay &#39;secret&#39; if they&#39;d laid a path all the way to it? 

For now though, you have no reason to leave the path. You walk for a few more minutes. You&#39;re //attempting// to relax. The night is rather peaceful, to be honest. When you&#39;re not running for your life or being assaulted by spirits. Up ahead is a nice big clearing of trees... 
The path terminates in a little... bubble of pebbles, up ahead. A circular area on the ground, like the end of a joystick. Just great. 
You can //always turn back,// if you feel it&#39;s necessary. 

You scan the surrounding area. 
Straight ahead to the **north**, you can actually hear some bubbling and flowing, like there&#39;s water close by. Water will mean a boat, right? 
And yet, there seems to be some flickering lights up ahead. Not directly straight, but sort of angled left, or rather **northwest.** Maybe the boathouse is that way instead? The gravel from the path looks like it&#39;s swept that way a little. Like someone&#39;s gone this way before, perhaps even recently. 

If you turn **west** and look hard, you can see a slightly worn path in the treeline. Some of the plantlife here looks like it&#39;s been trampled down. You can&#39;t see what&#39;s in there, but it looks pretty &quot;secret-y.&quot; 
And then, to the **east,** you can see there&#39;s another clearing about a hundred feet or less... and it looks like it&#39;s been burnt. Is it even worth checking out? 
It looks like there&#39;s another little worn-down spot of grass and vegetation to the **northeast**, though. It looks kinda dry and dusty. Could that be the right way? How big is this island, that you&#39;re not even that close to the water, apparently? 

Behind you, in the woods to the **south,** you hear a very loud lupine HOWL. Fuck... he might be on your trail again. You actually hear laughter though, from... by the slave cabins? What the //hell// is going on, on this island? 

Where do you go? 

[[WEST, taking the trampled path through the woods.-&gt;Path To Distillery]] 

[[NORTHWEST, towards the lights glowing and blinking.-&gt;Wisp Lights]] 

[[NORTH, towards the sound of bubbling, flowing liquid.-&gt;Gas Pit]] 

[[NORTHEAST, along the dusty-looking path in the trees.-&gt;Path to SB]] 

[[EAST, towards the blackened clearing.-&gt;Burnt Clearing]] 

[[SOUTH, if you want to risk it-&gt;RearNorth Hub Revert]] and check out the slave cabins anyway. </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="376" name="Slave Cabins" tags="TRIM RG" position="991,3116" size="100,100">This are feels... ominous. 
You don&#39;t like it automatically, since these tiny huts were obviously meant to house slaves and remind them of their place, while they could just barely see the lavish splendor of the master&#39;s mansion through their windows. Each one has one room, a COUPLE seem to be slightly larger. And that&#39;s not saying much. 

And there are people in them. 

You hear a man panting. Groaning quietly. Grunting. 

And a woman. Two women? 

Another man-- THAT&#39;S BEAU. That&#39;s. That&#39;s Beau&#39;s big husky growly werewolf voice, grunting and humping away in the undergrowth. 

&quot;Oohhhoohhh make me PREGNANT again,&quot; a female voice wails. 

&quot;I&#39;mma. Breed. You. Full. You. Always. Gon&#39; be. Pregnant.&quot; Beau huffs and puffs. 

shit. 
shit. 
you are WAY too close to them. 

You sneak away. No fuckin&#39; way are you getting grabbed by him and... have THAT done to you. Not when you&#39;re this close to escape. It sounds like Beau&#39;s taken captives... for breeding purposes. And at least ONE of them is a male. 

Like you. 

[[You return to the main path.-&gt;RearNorth Hub]] 

AN-TRIM</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="377" name="Wisp Lights" tags="WL" position="1035,2487" size="100,100">You creep ahead, off the beaten path, into the bushes. 

The lights... at first you thought they were flames, but they&#39;re actually colorful! And they //do// flicker like fire but they also seem to ebb and eddy like visible wind. 

It almost looks like... big fireflies? But they&#39;re //brilliant.// They&#39;re like, beautiful little blue and green and gold bursts of color and light. 

And they float in the air. They&#39;re just up ahead, through the next bundle of trees. You&#39;re quite close. A few of them drift in your direction, but otherwise they circle each other in a swirling light show. 

Why, oh WHY did your phone battery have to die?? You could be taking pictures, video! This is incredible! It&#39;s almost like a little mini aurora of colorful rays... 

almost //magical...// and that makes you wonder. Your inner skeptic rears up to ask you: are you an explorer and investigator, or a curious cat about to lose one of his lives? 

[[Head back to the previous clearing.-&gt;WispLights Reject]]

It looks like a very smoothed-over piece of ground. You don&#39;t see any grass or vegetation, either, it&#39;s like-- 

//BLOOP//

It bubbles. 
Oh shit. Is it like, quicksand or something? 

Beyond it, through some trees ahead, you can actually see the waters of the bayou. You&#39;ve made it to the far shore, probably the northernmost point of the island... but you&#39;re not sure if you&#39;ve found the boathouse described in the letter. 

If you think this area is worth exploring, then by all means, stay and check it out. At least there&#39;s no werewolves here. You&#39;ll have to be careful of that suspicious bubbly pit though... it looks like classic cartoon-depictions of quicksand, but you know that in real life things might be a bit different. Maybe you can find a branch or something to toss in there and test it out. Or poke down to feel how deep it is... 

Of course, you can turn back, if you don&#39;t think this place is worth your time. 

[[Inspect the place a little closer.-&gt;Swamp Girl]]

It looks like a BOMB went off here or something-- the trees around the edges of the circle are only half-burnt though, and bent outwards. What... the hell? How did this happen? 

There&#39;s a ghost in the middle of the blackened clearing. He doesn&#39;t look, well. Old. That is to say, he&#39;s the ghost of a young man, yes, but a more //modern// young man. He&#39;s squatting near something that turns out to be a white-and-blue ghostly fire. It roars up quickly, and grows into a full-size bonfire. 

Must be how the place ended up a crater in the trees. Idiot teenage boys playing with accelerants... ohh shit, that means-- 

You jerk, startled, as you see ghost boys all around you, quite suddenly. Ghost everything! You see a ghost //table full of snacks.// There&#39;s a ghost keg. Ghost logs and chairs to sit on. 

Most of these guys are fairly well-built, as well. 
And loud. You cringe. They&#39;re like... doing keg stands, chugging, playing beer pong, they&#39;re

Well fuck-your-sister-and-call-her-Hester. 
You&#39;ve stumbled into a ghostly party of FRAT BROS. 
Fan. Tastic. 

That would definitely explain the constant use of the words &#39;dude&#39; and &#39;bro&#39; all around you. There&#39;s a few female ghosts in sight too, but... this is a sausage-fest for the most part. 

Well, here you are surrounded by beefy drunk jock-bros and mischief and debauchery. No one really seems to notice you yet, so... if you&#39;re unnerved by all this, you could TOTALLY sneak back the way you came. 

However. Maybe these guys could help you figure out where that secret boathouse is? Or at the very least, if you hang here long enough, you might get a clue as to how they all died. All together. If you really wanna see. 

What do you do?

You&#39;re honestly more than a little curious by now. Hopefully it&#39;s worth it; you feel like you&#39;re close to escape and freedom, but part of you REALLY wants to know what&#39;s really happening on this island. 

You THOUGHT it was supposed to be haunted by ghosts n&#39; shit! Which, it is, but... no one mentioned the werewolf. 

You can see the slave cabins up ahead. You can definitely slip into that cluster of little buildings, if you want, and try to figure things out. Is that someone moaning, like... like they&#39;re being fucked? Is that a //woman?// 

You shiver. Hey, no one would blame you for turning back.

Are they just fireflies? Is this some kind of trick involving swamp gas or something? Only one way to find out! There&#39;s no way you&#39;re gonna get an opportunity like this again... 

A couple of them drift through the air almost lazily towards you, like they&#39;re checking you out. You reach out with the back of your hand, as if towards a strange dog. 

Ohh they&#39;re //warm//! You retract your hand slightly, a little nervous. Each little spot of light alternates between looking like a soft, glowing orb, and flaring up with a quick burst of fire and sparks. They don&#39;t seem to be doing any damage to the plantlife around here though. 

You don&#39;t see the one that lands on your shoulder until it&#39;s already rolled forwards and is visible in your peripheral vision, which startles you, but you crane your neck to look sideways at it, and then another one hovers before you. You reach up and let it land in your palm. 

Ho. Ly. Shit. 

They&#39;re little //fairies!!// 
Each one of these hovering lights is actually a tiny little flash-drive-sized person, with a slender body and delicate proportions and lovely, buzzy little dragonfly wings. Some are blue and some are orange and some are green and as you look up, you see more of them appearing around you, lighting the night with even more colors; reds and pinks show up, and purples, and whites and even a few who seem to //darken// the area around them to make their compatriots lights even more luminous. 

A few more land in your hand. You can hear them squeaking. They&#39;re //adorable.// You lean close.

Of course those are like MEDIEVAL tales, but... here you are on an island with other supernatural phenomena, so... your instincts might be serving you well here. [[You back away, and head back to the main path.-&gt;RearNorth Hub2]]  

Hey, you can always come back here later if you really feel like getting closer... </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="383" name="Path to SB" tags="" position="26,3699" size="100,100">There&#39;s definitely a path leading this way. You try to stay quiet and not do any classic horror movie bullshit like step on loud sticks that crack. You start thinking of... ugh, //movies,// movies where you get to see things from the monster&#39;s point of view, hunting the protagonists, able to pick them off easily in the dark. 

You put some hustle in your step. Your instincts are telling you something&#39;s off. You&#39;ve either... picked the wrong direction to go, or it&#39;s the RIGHT direction to go and someone, or someTHING, knows you&#39;re here. 

You&#39;re definitely getting closer to the water, if that&#39;s any consolation. You can hear the sound of liquid, slopping against something more solid. 

Did you make a mistake? Should you turn back and try a different path? 

[[Yeah, this is wrong. Head back.-&gt;Goo from SB Path]] 

[[Nono. Keep walking. Confirm it&#39;s right or wrong first.-&gt;Secret Boathouse]] </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="384" name="Wisp Lights Ending 2" tags="WL badend" position="1029,2206" size="100,100">Ohhh gooossshhh they GIGGLE
they laugh
they&#39;re so CUTE
You&#39;re holding tiny little cute fairies who glow
Your life is complete now, right?? 
Tiny small little cute friends 

They&#39;re all coming in close to check you out now
You can&#39;t help but smile
You have to laugh, they tickle, they have little hands and feet and they crawl on you... some are on your head, checking out your hair. Some are crawling down your neck, into your shirt, you&#39;re just covered in awesome beautiful bright lights like a walking rainbow. 

Ooo... heehhehehehe. Did one just crawl down your pants? 
You glance down. The ones in your shirt are shining their lights through the fabric, crawling along your chest and belly. A few fairies float down to watch their friends scale your mass like a mountain in reverse. 

Heheheh! Tickles!! It tickles!! STOP! Hahahahehehe

You shiver and twitch at the feel of their little digits grasping you and crawling along. At their soft wings beating. You giggle; you&#39;re trying to keep it quiet but it&#39;s like. It&#39;s like having puppy whiskers brushing all over you. 

One of them squeaks a couple times behind you. Another one pokes its face into your bellybutton to see what&#39;s in there; obviously it doesn&#39;t get very far. Another takes a peek inside your nose, and yet another lifts your upper lip to inspect your teeth. 

WHOA did one of them just...?? Was that.....??? 
YIKES!! You jump and scoot forwards, away from the cloud of fairies, as you feel one of them poke into your butthole and start to wriggle inside. You yelp and slap at your ass and undo your pants to pull them down and reach back there... 

[[You grasp the fairy&#39;s kicking legs,-&gt;Wisp Lights Ending 3]] sticking out of your hole. </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="385" name="Wisp Lights Ending 3" tags="badend WL" position="1024,2060" size="100,100">As you tug on the fairy half in your butt, whimpering and gasping in surprise, another one floats up to your face, giggling, and swoops directly into your mouth. 

You tilt backwards and nearly fall, gagging. You can feel it crawling to the back of your throat and taking the plunge. When you reach back again for the one in your ass, it&#39;s not there anymore. It&#39;s crawled inside as well. 

And your pants are now down. You have just enough time to let loose a terrified wail before the rest of the cloud of fairies descends upon you in a giggling frenzy. One by one, almost in formation, they swirl about and invade your orifices. First, another one wriggles into your ass again, and as your mouth opens wide involuntarily, a fourth takes the opportunity presented. 

You fall to all fours, coughing, squirming, sobbing and squealing in fear and indignation, but they&#39;re coming in so fast now you can&#39;t even do anything. You try to bite them when they crawl into your mouth, but they seem to be able to avoid your teeth with ease. You try to clench your hole shut. You flail about with your arms and end up thrashing around in the grass for a few minutes, until you&#39;ve exhausted yourself and can only lay there in tears as the rest of the fairies enter their new home. 

And you watch your poor, overfilled tummy plump up like a baking cake in an oven, and you can see it GLOWING from within. Your hands clutch the tight skin of your midsection, as if you could squish it back flat. 

Finally, it&#39;s over. You roll to get up on your feet again, taking a moment on all fours to catch your breath and gather yourself together again... 

But suddenly you feel an intense burst of pressure and heat from inside. You gasp, and look down with wide eyes, as your belly positively //balloons// like a cartoon character, until it looks like you&#39;ve draped yourself over a large beach ball. You can&#39;t curse or speak or protest. You&#39;re utterly shocked. 

And then
It gets
even
bigger

You try to yell for help as you watch your engorged stomach reaching an absolutely insane, //obscene// size, but there is no one around to help you at all, and you feel your entire body starting to lift off the ground. You are laying atop your own abdomen, inflated to the size of a fucking dairy cow, a gigantic ball filled with many glowing lights. 

And you float. 

**END** 

You have been turned into a LIVING AIRSHIP for the fairies! 

Now you know why the stories of people being lured off by mysterious lights and never heard from again... you understand
it&#39;s not that they died, it&#39;s that they were... um

invaded by fucking tiny FAIRIES
and blown up from the inside

and you shiver and cry as you lift high into the deep blue night sky, like a great big paper lantern, your vast belly glowing merrily below your limp, useless limbs and body. The fairies are steering you to new lands, onward to adventure! </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="386" name="Swamp Girl" tags="SG" position="778,2384" size="100,100">You scope the area and pick up a decent-sized stick, using it to probe the ground ahead. You&#39;ve heard that doing so is a great way to be aware of quicksand. Apparently the ground is supposed to //ripple// like water... 

So this isn&#39;t quicksand. It&#39;s more like, bubbling mud. This must be what they call, &quot;swamp gas.&quot; 

&quot;Don&#39;t worry, it ain&#39;t too deep honey!&quot; says a bright female voice behind you. 
You wheel quickly to face her. 

She is a ghost. 
She&#39;s a couple inches shorter than you, with some //thick// limbs-- shapely, but the girl&#39;s definitely strong. She&#39;s wearing pigtails and a tight tanktop and true-blue Daisy Duke shorts that terminate in fuzzy little shreds of denim. 

She&#39;s got to be BARELY 20 years old. She&#39;s grinning ear-to-ear. &quot;So where&#39;ve you been all this time?&quot; 

&quot;I... huh?&quot; you ask. 

She dives downwards, //into the ground,// and comes up right behind you. Before you can react, she&#39;s wrapped her arms around your chest, and YANKED you backwards. 

The pair of you [[SPLAT into the mud.-&gt;Mudpit]] </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="387" name="Path To Distillery" tags="DIST" position="605,2876" size="100,100">As you step carefully over fallen branches and roots, there&#39;s an odd sense of foreboding: you&#39;re willingly walking into the woods. That&#39;s NEVER a good idea, at least in horror movies and ghost stories. 

But... you&#39;re nothing if not intrepid. This //is// how you make your living after all. Compared to werewolves and real-life ghosts, a spooky lil forest ain&#39;t much. 

There&#39;s, um... up ahead. There&#39;s a shed or something. A shack, a cabin... flat-roof, one window. 
It&#39;s a squat little building, decrepit and slightly-rotten looking. Like someone&#39;s shed that their great-grandpa built and they don&#39;t go in anymore and there&#39;s probably a family of opossums living inside. You don&#39;t see any lights inside... looks like no one&#39;s home. 

Do you, um, wanna actually go in here? This doesn&#39;t look like the boathouse at all. For one thing... there&#39;s no water in sight. You&#39;re deep in the woods. The main path isn&#39;t strictly visible, but you&#39;re sure you can find your way back, as there&#39;s just enough moonlight... 

[[Enter the small building.-&gt;Distillery]] 

[[Turn around and head back.-&gt;RearNorth Hub2]] </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="388" name="Goo from SB Path" tags="GOO" position="161,3704" size="100,100">You shiver as you head back where you came from. This fucking island has you all shaken up and doubting yourself... fuck! You try some deep breathing. 

You hear sloshing and slurping. 
//That&#39;s not water.// Something up ahead in the woods is... moving around. Something very slimy-sounding. It&#39;s like hearing the sound of someone throwing a bucket of water to splash someone else, but without all the accompanying little droplets of water. Like a wet slapping noise. 

You could keep walking. It doesn&#39;t sound like the werewolf, this close. It should be easy to look ahead and see any incoming threats along the path. 

But that DOES give them the chance to see //you.// And it&#39;s always better to not be seen at all, right? 

What do you do? 

[[Keep moving along the path.-&gt;RH2 from SB]] 

[[Hide in the woods until things quiet down.-&gt;GOO Imp SB]] </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="389" name="Secret Boathouse" tags="RG" position="28,3829" size="100,100">Ok. Ok. Just gotta relax. You keep hearing that liquid-y noise, but it sounds... well, you hear it up //ahead,// where it makes sense, but you also hear it //behind you.// 

Which suggests you really should press on, because you&#39;re not sure you want to find out why you hear it behind you on dry land. Not that an island in the middle of a bayou is really ever //dry,// but hey. 

You walk around a big cypress tree and see a shape up ahead, overgrown with foliage but unmistakably a man-made structure. Could this be it? Where&#39;s the waterline? You approach. 

There&#39;s a door. You reach out to try the knob. It&#39;s locked. 
Of course, a door this old, you could probably kick in easily enough. It&#39;d crumple after a few good strong impacts. Normally you&#39;d be opposed to causing any sort of damage to the various places you visit, buuuut this time-- 

That KEY. You reach down to grab it out of your pocket. 

That&#39;s when you hear the howling. 
The //Rougarou// is close. Sounds like he&#39;s back along the pathway, in that little circular area of gravel. 

Fuck! What do you do? 

[[Try to unlock the door.-&gt;SB Unlock]] 

[[Hide in the woods!-&gt;SB Hide]] </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="390" name="SB Unlock" tags="RG end" position="159,3825" size="100,100">Fuck, fuck. FUck. FUCK

You cram the key in the door. It&#39;s an old piece of shit, rusty-ass lock and it&#39;s very uncooperative. You try to wriggle it, and you can feel it unlocking, but it&#39;s taking FOREVER. 
It&#39;s like when you get home late at night and are calmly turning the key in your door to let yourself in, but your brain goes wild and imagining having to rush it like a horror movie before the monster comes from the darkness to get you... and then you do something stupid like drop your keys in the mud... 

The lock finally seems to operate properly and you hear a //click.// 

There is an immense THUD just behind you and a huge, furry hand slaps onto the doorframe, right beside your face. 

Beau leans his monstrous visage into your view, reclining casually against the boathouse. &quot;Well. Color me impressed, smol fren.&quot; 

You glare up at him. You did NOT make it this far to die here. You clutch the key in your fist like a tiny shiv, ready to go down fighting. &quot;Why won&#39;t you just LEAVE ME ALONE??&quot; 

Beau makes no moves to grab you, assault you, nothing. He just folds his mighty arms and smirks, showing all his teeth. &quot;You gave me a good run. No one else so far, EVER tired me out like this. Been huntin&#39; you all night. I think you deserve... well, I think WE both deserve a reward.&quot; 

You stand your ground. At the first sign of a movement you don&#39;t like, you&#39;re gonna put that key in the softest, most vulnerable part of him you can reach. 

[[&quot;I&#39;mma make you a deal.&quot;-&gt;End Beau Deal]] </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="391" name="SB Hide" tags="GOO" position="26,3964" size="100,100">You find a tree to duck behind, and you debate for a second if you should try climbing it. Nope. Too high, no footholds, but. It&#39;s thick and should obscure you just fine. So you crouch down behind it, out of sight. 

There&#39;s a thumping noise, rhythmic, just like the sound of... wait. WAIT no. That&#39;s a different sound. That&#39;s not the werewolf, but... you&#39;re not sure you want to know what it is at all. It&#39;s sloppier and slower and... it&#39;s still got a rhythm to it but it sounds like a fucking MUD monster instead of a werewolf... 

Either way, you hold very still and stay as quiet as humanly possible. You wait for the footsteps to leave. 

When you hear them heading off into the forest, you take a risk, and peer juuuuust around the tree... 

It looks... fuck, it&#39;s a mud monster isn&#39;t it. It&#39;s vaguely... a dark, yet transparent sort of color; you can&#39;t tell in this lighting or from this distance. It&#39;s gloppy-gloopy-mushy. That&#39;s all you need to see. Not something you want catching you at all: it&#39;ll probably dissolve you into soup if it so much as touches you! 

Once you&#39;re //absolutely// sure it&#39;s gone, you head to the door, and unlock it, and step inside. And you shut the door and lock it behind you as well. And you leave the key on the floor just inside the door. 

The trip was long and scary and the lock was rusty and stubborn, but you are now [[standing inside the secret boathouse-&gt;Secret Boathouse Interior]] mentioned in Waylon&#39;s letter. </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="392" name="RH2 from SB" tags="" position="300,3707" size="100,100">You decide to press on. This little footpath is //just// well-lit enough that you should be able to spot any potential threats ahead, and maneuver to safety in time. If it was the Rougarou, you&#39;d have probably chosen to hide, but he&#39;s got much heavier footsteps than these weird mushy-slappy noises. 

You take a moment to stop and listen. 
The noises sound... further away. Maybe you passed them? 

Either way, forget them. You keep moving and eventually see the clearing with the circular end of the main path, up ahead. 

[[You&#39;ve made it back.-&gt;RearNorth Hub2]] </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="393" name="GOO Imp SB" tags="GOO" position="433,3702" size="100,100">You look around quickly, and see a big log nearby, laying almost parallel to the path. There&#39;s plenty of vegetation to hide under, so, even though the log&#39;s not hollow, you should be out of sight here. 

You crouch on all fours behind the log. You&#39;re able to peek over and see the footpath a few feet away. If you hear or see any threats approaching, you should be able to just lie flat and be completely hidden under the bushes and leaf cover. 

Ugh. That gross, sloppy, sloshy noise is definitely close by. You can&#39;t tell which direction it&#39;s coming from though... it sounds almost like it&#39;s all around? You hear some slaps off to the right, and some across the path, and even a few somewhere behind you...? 

You glance backwards. 

Hopping through the bushes in your direction is a round, glistening green ball of animate goo. It&#39;s about the size of a german shepherd, except ball-shaped obviously... and it&#39;s moving much, MUCH faster than you&#39;d expect a little jello monster to move. 

You start to turn around to face it, but it //launches// itself through the air and smacks into your back, and holy crap the fucker&#39;s HEAVIER than you expected. You push up off the ground hard with both arms, trying to throw it off you. You can feel it sticking to you; it sends tendrils of its own mass around your torso like it&#39;s inspecting you for itself. 

OH HELL NO It&#39;s crawling into your pants, down the back, it&#39;s sliding along your asscrack IT&#39;S GOING INTO YOUR ASSHOLE!!! You yell and your legs propel you forward out of your hiding place, back onto the path... 

where you stumble a few feet before falling to all fours, gasping and panting with your tongue hanging out. 

The goo-ball is pushing a soft, slippery line of itself into your butt, and //stroking// you from the inside. Your arms and legs go limp, shaky, unable to fight, barely able to keep you from collapsing completely. It&#39;s //probing// you. Why??!? What is the purpose?! What could it WANT?? 

There are heavy footsteps incoming... your heart sinks. 
The Rougarou might&#39;ve heard you yell out. 

You shiver in fear and indignation, and clap a hand to your mouth to cover your involuntary moan of forbidden pleasure. The slime pulses inside your ass... you think it&#39;s putting some of itself in your guts. 

[[Fuck. Fuck. Fuck. Fucking. Fuck.-&gt;GOO Imp RG]] </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="394" name="GOO Imp RG" tags="GOO RG" position="416,3832" size="100,100">You sink down further, before finally collapsing onto your elbows, face nearly in the dirt, ass up in the air being stuffed. Ohh shit. Holy shit. You. You can feel it. Your ass. Your ass is like. //Sucking// on it. Sucking it in. Gobbling it up. Why?!? Why can&#39;t you... clench, and keep it ooOOUUTUOTU THAT MAKES IT WORSE FUCKING SHIT. 

You can feel a cool sloshy pool starting to form in your tummy. You shiver. Your boner is rock-hard and threatening to put a hole in your jeans. Another soft moan can&#39;t be helped. Dammit, your asshole is like. Uggh, it&#39;s like it&#39;s //slurping// the goop into itself... or maybe that&#39;s the slimeball&#39;s own ministrations but... 

You cringe when you happen to glance back. The slimeball has shrunk. It&#39;s clinging to your back, above your rear end, and it&#39;s shrinking. Oh. Ohh crap. You hang your head and look underneath yourself to see that your belly is starting to fill up and round out, hanging below you like a pouch as it fills up with goo. Bigger, and bigger, with each pulse of slime, each pump of green goo into your guts. 

And then a massive furry pair of werewolf feet step up to you. 
Slowly, you look up at the ten-foot-tall monster. 

&quot;Now, //dammit,// why&#39;d you have to go playin&#39; with the slime?&quot; says Beau&#39;s drawling voice. The werewolf leans down, sniffing you. You cringe away from him. 

&quot;... help?&quot; you say in a tiny, mewling voice. Then you quiver and start to cream your jeans. The slime slides in deeper. You&#39;re getting //very// full now... it&#39;s kinda getting hard to breathe. Your poor tummy is feeling packed to the brim. 

&quot;Ain&#39;t much I can do at this point,&quot; Beau grumbles. He sighs and folds his big, burly arms. &quot;If you&#39;d-a just let ME catch you, instead...&quot; 

&quot;Somehow... I think. I&#39;m fucked. Either way.&quot; You manage to squeak out. 

&quot;Yeah but I&#39;d be more fun,&quot; Beau snorts. &quot;Welp. Hurry up and suck the rest of it in, I&#39;ll getcha back to the house to recuperate, nah.&quot; 

You emit a rather pitiful open-mouthed whine as your body arches and your ass slurps up the rest of the slimeball. The button on your jeans pops open, and then you sit back on your haunches. It never even took your clothes off, it just trickled down inside. And now you have a big round bubbling belly sitting in your lap. 

Beau sighs. &quot;Welp, c&#39;mon nah.&quot; 
He reaches down, lifts you up, and bridal-carries you off. 
His gentle motions and soft warm fur cause you to [[drift off to sleep.-&gt;GOO Imp End]] </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="395" name="GOO Imp End" tags="GOO RG end" position="416,3982" size="100,100">You wake up. 

You&#39;re not in the mansion. And you&#39;re not... quite outside either? 
It&#39;s daylight. You hear birds and all that. Nice sunlight... 

Oooooo you can&#39;t sit up properly; you can try, but you have a BIG belly in the way. Ooo it&#39;s like. It&#39;s like you&#39;re pregnant. It&#39;s probably... well, the slime was about the size of a medium-sized family dog, and... and now it&#39;s all curled up inside your tummy... so. 

You poke at it, wincing. How did THIS happen anyway. How did you //let// it happen? You should&#39;ve been paying better attention! 

You look around. You&#39;re in a little... like a cabin? It looks like it&#39;s sort of older, but it&#39;s furnished with some modern amenities and whatnot. You can hear the faint noise of a gas generator running somewhere nearby, and there&#39;s at least two electric lights sitting here. And then you hear the generator power down. The lights go off, likely since they aren&#39;t needed in the bright daylight. 

The sight of the hulking werewolf entering the cabin is just as horrifying in broad daylight as it would be in the middle of the night, but he shakes his head and shivers a little, and then you get to watch him shrinking, shrinking, turning back into Beau. He&#39;s, um. Nude. 
The guy frowns in your direction and shakes his head. &quot;That&#39;s just bad luck right there. I was havin&#39; a helluva a time tryna chase you down. You was good, man, you was real good.&quot; 

&quot;Good??&quot; You flop back on the bed he placed you on. &quot;You fucking TRAUMATIZED me man...&quot; 

&quot;Aww, c&#39;mon nah. I ain&#39;t even that scary.&quot; Beau chuckles. &quot;But you kept me runnin&#39; around all night, didn&#39;cha? It&#39;s cheatin&#39;, that damn slimeball stole my win.&quot; 

&quot;Your WIN?&quot; 

&quot;Hey. I was about to catch you for myself,&quot; Beau says. He heads to a dresser near the bed and pulls out some fresh clothes; a simple white t-shirt and cheap jeans. &quot;Difference is, //I// am an experienced and courteous lover, I guarantee. Slime don&#39;t care; slime just wants to be inside. And now I can&#39;t even breed you myself, after all that work tryna catch you!&quot; 

You curl up and clutch yourself, your bloated tummy //bloop//ing and //slosh//ing and //glorp//ing. &quot;What even. IS this fucking island.&quot; 

&quot;Well that&#39;s exactly what it is, ain&#39;t it? A FUCKING island,&quot; Beau laughs. He holds a strong hand out to help you up. &quot;C&#39;mere. Let&#39;s get you back where you belong.&quot; 

&quot;What about this fuckin&#39; GUT??&quot; you snap, cringing at the feel of your moist ass against your underwear. You feel like you&#39;re about to spring a leak or something. 

&quot;Ehh. It&#39;ll leave when it wants to,&quot; Beau shrugs. &quot;Just keep it well-fed while it&#39;s inside.&quot; 

And with that, he helps you hobble out, past all the little cabins, up to the mansion, and down the path to the little boathouse where his airboat sits waiting to return you to your car. 

**END** 

You have a GOO in your tummy! 

On the ride back, Beau explains a couple things. Unfortunately it&#39;s not enough to satisfy you, but it DOES at least seem that he&#39;s had one of these inside his own gut before, so... at least you get the feeling of like, reverse-empathy or whatever. Or maybe it&#39;s reverse-schadenfreude? The guy WAS gonna fuck you, after all. With a big werewolf dick. 

At any rate, you arrive safely at your car. Beau tells you a few more pieces of advice, and tells you to call him if you need some help, or a friend, or ever want to know what it&#39;s like to get CLAIMED by a werewolf (which you yourself are not exactly curious about, but... hey, some of your subscribers might be, who knows) and soon you&#39;re carefully driving back to your place. Every time you make a sharp turn or hit a bump, your belly gurgles and sloshes, making you horny and queasy at the same time. 

So! You&#39;re carrying a happy little slimy parasite in your tummy now! It looks like you&#39;ve grown yourself a proper, dad-ly beer gut overnight. You&#39;re not sure how you want to present yourself to the world, if even at all until this passes. But you&#39;ll have to figure something out. 

And you&#39;re hungry as FUCK, too. Despite the pleasant weather, you grab a hoodie and zip it up over your gut to try and hide how BIG you&#39;ve swollen. The goo bubbles in anticipation of a meal as you head into town looking for something to feed it with. Hopefully it&#39;s not a picky eater... and hopefully you don&#39;t run into anyone you know (or who knows you from the Internet!) </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="396" name="End Beau Deal" tags="RG end" position="289,3828" size="100,100">&quot;... a deal.&quot; You keep staring him down. You&#39;re on a hair-trigger. 

&quot;Yep. See, right now, let&#39;s face it. I gotcha dead-to-rights. Only reason one of us isn&#39;t stuffed deep into the other&#39;s //belly// right now,&quot; and Beau grins as his crotch twitches under his torn overalls, &quot;is, I think you played the game good and deserve to make it out ok.&quot; 

Stuffed into... ohh shit he&#39;s talking about... you shudder, but do your best to keep your wits about you. 

&quot;Now, in this here lil shed, is a flat-bottomed boat with a pole,&quot; Beau says. &quot;I KNOW you ain&#39;t never used one before, and I can almost guarantee that if I don&#39;t stop you from trying to leave in that little piece &#39;o shit, you gonna be gator chow within a couple minutes of headin&#39; out into the swamp. In the middle of the night. With no idea where you are, or where you be goin&#39;. So.&quot; Beau stands up tall as he can and stretches and yawns, and you feel utterly tiny and helpless standing next to his monstrous bulk. 

&quot;I think it&#39;s best if you just come with me. Let&#39;s go get some rest, have a lil fun, and in the mornin&#39; I&#39;mma take you back, no strings attached.&quot; 

&quot;What do you mean by &#39;a little fun,&#39;&quot; you ask, taking a few careful steps backwards. 

&quot;Well.&quot; Beau shrugs and rubs the back of his neck. &quot;I mean I was gonna fuck ya anyways, but. I was thinkin&#39; this could be a more, well, uhh... //respectful// sorta fuck.&quot; 

&quot;Dude I did NOT come here to get ass-raped by a werewolf!!&quot; 

&quot;Nono, that&#39;s the thing, lil buddy!&quot; Beau says. &quot;If I&#39;d caught you earlier, I&#39;d have made it, uhh, well. Rougher. And all. But I know how to please, you can ask anyone I got pregnant in the slave cabins just how //wrecked// they are once I&#39;m done with &#39;em.&quot; 

&quot;Ok and that&#39;s another thing!&quot; you say, shrilly. &quot;What&#39;s the deal with this PREGNANT stuff?? &#39;Cuz I wanna believe it&#39;s a euphemism but--&quot; 

Beau hooks a giant hand around the small of your back and tugs you close to his big, warm body. You swing at him by reflex, but he catches your wrist and holds you still. He grins. 

&quot;C&#39;mon and relax. Lemme //show ya.//&quot; 
And he scoops you up like a doll. You squirm when he buries his snout in your midriff and takes a long sniff. &quot;Mmm. I&#39;mma make you cum so hard, you won&#39;t ever wanna jerk off again.&quot; 

[[Beau carries you through the woods, towards the cabins.-&gt;End Beau Deal 2]] </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="397" name="End Beau Deal 2" tags="RG end" position="297,3968" size="100,100">He doesn&#39;t carry you to the emptier cabins though-- the ones you can see at least two faces looking out at you from. He takes you to a cabin with a running generator in the back, and a proper door, and... air conditioning? It&#39;s surprisingly modernized. 

And he sits down on the bed and takes another sniff of you. &quot;Mmmff. You&#39;re what I call, //ideal,// ma cher.&quot; 

You&#39;re quietly indignant. Did you really spend all this time outwitting and outmaneuvering him and the other threats on this island, only to end up... getting caught anyway? 

He tugs your pants off before you can put up any protests, and grips your thighs to spread you apart. Your head and upper body hang off his knees, and you feel OHH that&#39;s his tongue. He&#39;s licking your dick n&#39; balls, like... ohh. OHhohohohoh. Oh. Wow. You&#39;re hard within seconds. He suckles just a little. 

Are you... are you actually just... like. Gonna. Go along with this? This is a... first of all he&#39;s not even human, and he&#39;s a DUDE, and is that how you swing? 

As you have your little identity crisis Beau slides his tongue up between your cheeks and you quiver quite violently, and you really never thought THAT would make you feel good but maybe you just... maybe he&#39;s showing you something about yourself you never knew? 

You&#39;re hanging basically upside down in a werewolf&#39;s lap about to get anally penetrated. There&#39;s not really any more time to have second thoughts. Particularly with the way his arms are almost thicker around than your entire body. 

Beau takes a few moments to rub his pecker all up and down and in your crack, spreading slippery precum all over, and then begins to [[enter you.-&gt;End Beau Deal 3]] </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="398" name="End Beau Deal 3" tags="RG end" position="297,4118" size="100,100">You have never... well. 

You&#39;ve definitely never been dicked by a monster the size of a horse before. Your mind is not really capable of processing what&#39;s happening to you. You&#39;re far too horny at this point. It&#39;s like, somewhere inside, there was a button that you didn&#39;t know about, and Beau just pressed it, and voila! Superboner! 

He cradles you gently. His hands wrap around your body as he holds you upright in his lap. &quot;Never had it this good before, ma cher?&quot; he murmurs. His soft fur rubs your face as he nuzzles against your cheek and holds you close to his chest. 

And then he starts to //cum in your belly.// Goodness, does he start. To. CUM. You shoot your own load all over him as the pressure increases inside you and your stomach engorges with his seed. 

With each beat, each pulse of Beau&#39;s monster-schlong, you feel your body //stretching// to fit more of his cum. You twitch in his grasp and you&#39;re pretty sure you go unconscious a little... 

Nah, you REALLY go unconscious. 

**END** 

You wake up. 
You&#39;re lying in the cabin still, in a nice warm... breathing... bed? 
No, you&#39;re lying on top of Beau. He&#39;s still a werewolf. His massive fur-coated pecs make good pillows, honestly. 

OH SHIT. You fucked a werewolf!! Or rather, the werewolf fucked YOU. Like. Royally. 
You moan as you stretch and try to... ohh WOW. 

You&#39;ve got a very, VERY full belly. Shit. //Shit.// What the hell?? He put THAT much cum inside you? 

Beau&#39;s big furry werewolf hand reaches around you and his large fingers splay over your stomach. Another hand spreads across your chest. He pulls you close like a stuffed animal, groaning, laughing softly. &quot;Mornin&#39;, lil buddy.&quot; 

His hands rub all over your front. You feel them shrinking. Your bleary eyes can see his fur disappearing and his arms returning to normal human proportions. 

&quot;You&#39;re changing back into a human?&quot; 

&quot;Well. I got you pregnant, so. Not much reason to stay wolfed-out, ma cher,&quot; Beau mumbles into the back of your neck. 

&quot;... pregnant?&quot; you ask, in a tiny voice. 

In response he just clasps your belly with both hands and giggles into your hair. Mmm. Mmm that feels nice. He spoons the fuck outta you and his manhood&#39;s hard in the small of your back and... //wow// he made you pregnant?? What a... what a STUD. Are there actually little werewolf babies in here? You reach down to feel your stomach. Your tight, firm, bubbly-feeling stomach. 

&quot;You ready to head on back?&quot; Beau mutters as one of his hands ruffles your hair. 

You take a deep breath, and you... yawn. 

&quot;... you know.&quot; 

&quot;Mmm?&quot; 

You grin and close your eyes. &quot;We ain&#39;t gotta go back... //just yet.//&quot; 

&quot;Mmm, now you&#39;re talkin,&quot; Beau rumbles, squeezing you close, like a big buddy should. </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="399" name="Secret Boathouse Interior" tags="TRIM" position="26,4114" size="100,100">Inside the dark little wooden shack, you hear water slapping faintly, and you can just make out a little square-cornered boat. If you didn&#39;t know it was a boat, you&#39;d almost guess it was... well, ok. It&#39;s at least //curved,// but the sides are so low it might as well be a floating door! 

There&#39;s no oars either. Not even a rudder! How are you supposed to... 

Ohhhh. There&#39;s a pole. A big long pole. Apparently you... have to push. Ok. Ok. You can do this. Just like... kayaking. Right? People do it all the time. 

You get in the boat. It&#39;s //wobbly.// You&#39;re very, very nervous about this... ok. Ok. Just stick the pole in the water, and... give it a lil push. 

Hey, HEY! You&#39;re moving! 

This might actually //work.// Now you just have to figure out where exactly to go... 

Well, now that you think of it, a good place to start would be the place you arrived at the island in the first place: Beau&#39;s boathouse. You try to imagine the island&#39;s layout, and reason that you&#39;re basically on the opposite side of the island from the other boathouse. So...

A classic fixture of more backwoods and western pieces of fiction than you care to think about. You&#39;re pretty sure drinking anything that comes out of this hunk of junk would be about the //stupidest// idea you could think of, and yet... 

You smirk. Might be a fun night with some friends, if there&#39;s ever a special occasion. &quot;Hey guys. What about this here... 2000% Swamp-Ass Hooch from some bumpkin&#39;s still in the middle of a haunted bayou?&quot; Who knows what debauchery... you might get up to. 

You look the equipment over. There&#39;s some knobs, levers, a valve. Are you... gonna touch any of it?

There&#39;s some odds and ends scattered about. A dry pen, the shattered handle of a coffee mug, an empty plastic water bottle, a screwdriver. 

And some papers. Some sticky notes and leaves of notebook paper. Many of them are, uhh, //rather wet,// so it&#39;s possible there&#39;s a leak in the roof or someone spilled some booze on them. 

You lay the notes with legible words out and try to glean some information.

The handwriting is very, VERY hard to read, especially in the dark. It&#39;s a guy&#39;s handwriting, unmistakeably. A guy who either doesn&#39;t know how to write properly, or who&#39;s so intelligent he can&#39;t be bothered with pleasing penmanship. 

Some of these notes seem to be in regard to the **bottles** you see on the shelf by the desk. There&#39;s also something about the **still** holding a secret? 

What&#39;s your next move? 

[[Take a look at the bottles.-&gt;Distillery Bottles]] 

[[Have a go at the still?-&gt;Moonshine Still]] 

[[Nothing just yet.-&gt;Distillery]] </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="402" name="Distillery Bottles" tags="DIST" position="332,2852" size="100,100">You have a look at the worn-looking shelving attached to the wall near the desk. There&#39;s mostly just empty bottles here. Some are larger than others, some are plastic, some are ceramic, some are glass. And they&#39;re not uniformly proper &quot;cute magic potion&quot; bottles either, like Eliza&#39;s were. They&#39;re a cobbled mixture of old and new. There&#39;s liter pop bottles that definitely don&#39;t hold root beer or grape soda anymore. 

Most of the empty ones are dusty and webby. There are TWO, though, that still have stuff in them. 

The **larger bottle** is ceramic, opaque, corked, and utterly reeks of alcohol. You uncork it to take a peek inside, and it is absolutely, unmistakably, some of the strongest booze you&#39;ve ever smelled. You feel almost buzzed just //looking// at it. Is it fucking GLOWING slightly? 

The **smaller bottle** is a green glass beer bottle, possibly an import from Germany or Mexico. It doesn&#39;t have a cap on it anymore, and nor is it corked; there&#39;s a piece of cotton fabric draped over the top with some string tied tightly around it to hold it in place. It also smells like beer, but that might be because of its origins rather than the liquid currently inside. Whatever it is, it&#39;s very dark, and not beer at all. 

It is //entirely// up to you if you want to say. Sample one of these. You gotta ask yourself if you feel lucky. Do ya? Which one has the iocaine powder in it? Delectable tea, or deadly poison? 

Ok really though. Which one, if either, do you drink from? 

[[Take a sip from the bigger bottle-&gt;Big Bottle]] and see how get you drunk. 

[[Have a swig from the smaller bottle-&gt;Small Bottle]] despite the fact that there&#39;s no &quot;Drink Me!&quot; sign attached.

Traveling through the woods seems to take no time at all. It may have just been a small, podunk little shed with a still hidden inside, but there&#39;s still that all-too-human rush of &quot;I discovered some ruins!&quot; that you can&#39;t help but feel thrilled by.

There&#39;s a loud //CHUNK.// A metallic //CLUNK.// 

And then a big **POP**. You step back, and then look closer, angling your head around the machine to see. 

Ooo shit. There&#39;s another little **POP** and a spark of light-- 

**EV ER Y THING GOES BRIGHT WHITE** 

Uhhggghhh FUCK man. You raise your head. Where... are you? Are you still... heheh. In the forest? Hot damn, you must&#39;ve managed to get some shine outta that still after all!

Wait a second. WAAAAIT a second. You actually //ARE// floating. 

AWESOME!!! 

Oh wait. Wait. wait wait wait. 
WAIT IT&#39;S NOT AWESOME

Your eyes focus, and you have a look around, and... ohh SHIT dude. 
Everything&#39;s //burnt.// Everything&#39;s black. There&#39;s a hazy sky above you, and the trees around are all pushed over in a circle and blackened and... how did you survive that?? The fucking still exploded!!

You look down at yourself, and you... you start to sob. 
You didn&#39;t survive. 
You don&#39;t have //anything// anymore. 
You&#39;re a ghost. 
You&#39;re not even... You don&#39;t even have a proper human shape. You&#39;re formless. You&#39;re a hovering mass of ectoplasm, almost like a classic bedsheet ghost but without the sheet. 
You reach up to put your hand to your mouth, and you don&#39;t even have one. It&#39;s like a lump. A mitten-like extension of glowy-pale-white, like the rest of you. You... you can&#39;t even cry. 

Are you sober? You weren&#39;t before. You still aren&#39;t. The world&#39;s still spinning and you&#39;re like... you&#39;re a cloud. 

You&#39;re a ghost. 

**END** 

You have been BLOWN UP. 
You are now a shapeless little ghost. When you approach mirrors, you can only see a cloudy mess of ghostly essence. You are sometimes capable of //appearing// in your human form, but you can never keep it; within minutes you&#39;re drunk again, utterly sloshed, and your human shape fizzles or bloats into a ball before you return to your ghostly amorphous presence. 

It&#39;s not... it&#39;s not ALL bad. For one thing. You&#39;re DRUNK AS FUCK the entire time. You&#39;re basically **perma-drunk** now. And it gets better: wherever you go, wherever you choose to haunt, you seem to spread a //cloud of drunkenness// about the area. Like you&#39;re radioactive, but with intoxication. Whoever hangs out near you for even a couple minutes starts to catch a buzz, and any longer than that, well... 

And the only reason you find this out, is because apparently the explosion from the distillery was so big it could be seen for miles. People thought it was a //nuke// going off (of course, these are Southerners, so cut &#39;em a little slack). It made national news, and... well, your subscribers knew you&#39;d gone to the Bayou. 

So some of them came looking for you. 
And, like any self-respecting ghost, you umm. Hitched a ride with one of them. Letting you travel beyond your confines, beyond the tether of the spot where you left the mortal coil. 

Hey. 
Hey dude

It opens. </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="412" name="Dist Secret Room" tags="DIST" position="217,3391" size="100,100">You step into the room. It&#39;s a lot smaller, more like a broom closet. There&#39;s a shelf in here, and a little chair with a small writing desk attached, like you might find in a community college. 

The only thing of note you actually might want to look at is the **box** on the shelf. Otherwise, there&#39;s nothing else in here. 

Are you curious as to what&#39;s in the box? 

[[Open the box.-&gt;Dist Box]] 

[[Not really.-&gt;Distillery Leave to Path]] </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="413" name="Dist Box" tags="DIST" position="357,3394" size="100,100">You open the box-- ok, it&#39;s more of a plastic container but hey. 

Inside are some folders and files and papers. What... are they doing out here? What is this anyway, this little room? Is this like a //sales office//? Hahah. 

No wait...

Who the hell wrote-- did BEAU write these papers?? 

You sit reading with the flashlight for a minute. He DID. Wow. WOW look at this! &quot;I let her talk me into it, which was a failure on my part really. Almost as soon as I drank the mixture she gave me, I knew I&#39;d made a mistake. My entire body enlarged and I grew fur everywhere and... all I could think about was having sex. And eating. I&#39;d become little more than an animal--&quot; 

He writes rather //proper,// for someone so, um. Down-home. 

At least, he does earlier in this journal you&#39;ve found. As the dates get more and more recent, you start to notice a marked degeneration in his vernacular-- or to be more blunt, he starts sounding //dumber.// 

&quot;Went to town, got more food. Saw a hot little lady. Asked her on date.&quot; 
&quot;Still not working, need new parts, don&#39;t know what though&quot; 
&quot;Failed the class, dumb professors don&#39;t need a degree anyway I&#39;m happy here.&quot; 
&quot;Gettin bigger and bigger every day I am a sexy beast now I love it&quot; 

He was in college?? //Recently??// 

You read from the journal as long as you think the flashlight will hold. It soon starts to flicker out, signaling it&#39;s time for you to go. 

From what you could gather, Beau came here to study both the history of the place, AND to set up his own little brewery here... and do some experiments with local plant specimens. He was actually going into biology it seems, and then he met Eliza, struck up a little relationship with her but... at some point he decided he was too small and wimpy or something? So he started trying to... mix potions, like her. 

Except he kept screwing up, so he asked her for help, and... and she may have tricked him into becoming a //Rougarou,// that&#39;s the thing. 

Note to self? Don&#39;t trust Eliza in the future. She may have ulterior motives... 

Regardless, the flashlight&#39;s out and so&#39;s your phone, so you can&#39;t read anything else. You decide it&#39;s time to [[leave the shack and keep searching for the boathouse.-&gt;Distillery Leave to Path]] </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="414" name="Big Bottle" tags="badend" position="209,2858" size="100,100">You actually feel quite brave, don&#39;t you?

The cool liquid inside makes your lips tingle when it touches them. In your mouth, the flavor is amazing; it&#39;s got that fermented zing to it but it&#39;s like the best cocktail you&#39;ve ever had, sweet yet //powerful.// 

You kinda take... a little more than a tiny sip. A proper draught, really. There&#39;s still plenty left in the bottle but it&#39;s a bit lower than you intended to leave it. 
Hot //damn// it&#39;s warming your stomach up but good. You... **burp** you shiver a little, and laugh quietly. 

Ohhhh shit you&#39;re getting the shakes, BAD though. You reach up and rub your temples a bit, and... ohh. ohhhhhh CRAP

You double over, clutching your abdomen. You&#39;re absolutely gonna-- 

No wait, you&#39;re not? You... ugh, you just. You feel this big bad pressure inside, but. But it&#39;s like spreading everywhere. Drinking that shit was a mistake, definitely. You... you. You you you shake shake vibrate shiver shudder 

GGGRRRRROOOWWW
You yelp as you feel your entire body stretch and bulge and enlarge, shooting up by nearly a foot of height, and... and like, you&#39;re... uggh... you&#39;re all BIG now. How the hell?? What was IN THAT BOTTLE? 

You&#39;re shaking again, violently. You stagger backwards as your body shoots upwards another few inches; your clothes are getting tighter around you, and your shoes; your pants are pulling up off your ankles like a kid who&#39;s just had a growth spurt. Except this is on a MUCH larger scale. 

You cringe. You feel empty inside. Hollowed out. Your stomach is BEGGING for food. But. But there&#39;s no food here!! You actually let out a plaintive cry of pain from the sharp stabbing hunger in your gut and you lean back against the wall-- 

Ohh crap the shelf! The bottles all fall as you bump the shelf with your newly-enlarged body, and come crashing to the ground. THAT. That was not stealthy at all. You stare down at the big one, the one you just drank from, broken in half and the liquid inside faintly glowing before it sinks into the ground. 

HHrrrkk!! You&#39;re growing again!!

You wake up. 
You are... hmm. You seem to be quite drunk, slumped over a big soft pillow, listening to the sounds of sex and squealing and just... what? 

You&#39;re in the dining room of the mansion. Laying on your stomach on the table-- holy CRAP that&#39;s not a pillow. 

That&#39;s your gut. 
Your belly is a great big fat ball, like you&#39;ve been drinking all your life and have grown a //proud// beer belly to show off your prowess. 

Who the FUCK is FUCKING in the kitchen?? 
&quot;OOO LAWD HAVE MERCY BOY!!&quot; she shouts. Sounds like she&#39;s enjoying it as much as he... THEY, are... 

A ghost slides out from underneath you. &quot;S&#39;up, bro??&quot; He looks... like a frat boy. He just exudes it. The baseball cap backwards, the lush looking face, the dumb eyes, the... big broad shoulders. 

&quot;What... happened?&quot; you ask. &quot;Who the hell are you??&quot; 

&quot;Don&#39;t you remember me?&quot; he asks. &quot;It&#39;s me, Brendan!&quot; 

&quot;I... how&#39;d I get here?&quot; 

&quot;I dunno but I LOVE it inside you, man, you&#39;re so like. Healthy &#39;n shit.&quot; 

&quot;INSIDE ME??&quot; you shriek and scramble away from him. You just sort of flop backwards, your fat tummy wiggling above you, and the ghost comes with. You can see the lower half of his body sticking out of your stomach. 

&quot;Yeah man, we&#39;re like... body-bros now!&quot; the ghostly fratbro says. &quot;I&#39;mma hang with you for GOOD dude.&quot; Brendan puts a burly arm around your shoulders and ruffles your hair. &quot;We take care of our own.&quot; 

&quot;... body-bros??&quot; 

You manage to get up and have a look around the... the fucking TRASHED mansion, and there&#39;s ghosts. Everywhere. Sprawled over every surface, hovering in the air passed out, there&#39;s... that&#39;s BEAU laying there half in the fireplace, his furry werewolf gut bloated even bigger than yours with a ghost dude curled up happily on top of him. 

The enormously obese owner of the mansion, Waylon, suddenly rockets up from the basement. &quot;I HAVE SEEN THE DEVIL HERSELF AND SHE HAS EIGHT LEGS!!&quot; he bellows, his eyes wild. 

&quot;Seven vaGINAS,&quot; Beau mutters into the fireplace. 

Waylon emits a flustered, babbling sort of noise. He bounces in place for a moment before jumping straight up, agile as you please for a man who must&#39;ve weighed 1000 pounds when he died, and vanishes into the ceiling. You hear Eliza scream somewhere upstairs and start swearing. 

&quot;What. HAPPENED. In here?&quot; you ask. 

Brendan pops his face out of your swollen belly. &quot;You seriously don&#39;t remember bro? You came out of the woods with like. The best booze ever? And you gave it to, I think... I don&#39;t remember who you gave it to. But then like. That werewolf picked you up, ate you, spit you back out, and all of us were drinkin&#39; from that bottle and... shit dawg. I don&#39;t remember what happened either!!&quot; 

Welp. You... you have a ghost-bro in your tummy now! He can come out and hang around in your presence, allowing you to be flat-bellied whenever, but Brendan kinda... won&#39;t leave. And when he goes back inside you, you immediately feel too-buzzed-to-drive, and blimp back up to ex-jock-dad-beergut-sized. 

Sheesh, you came here to find ghosts, not share an earthly //vessel// with one! I think we&#39;ve all learned something today. And pretty soon, your subscribers are gonna be learning something special about YOU. </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="416" name="BigBoy End 1" tags="badend" position="195,2732" size="100,100">You push the door open and duck down-- sheesh you&#39;re like 8 feet tall now!-- and try to squeeze through the frame even as you feel another burst of shivery, twitchy growth run through your body. You grunt. 

Ohh fuck fuck fuck you&#39;re //stuck...// 
With a growl, you pull yourself free and get back to your feet. You&#39;re a bit dirty now, having had to almost lie on your side and crawl out, but at least you&#39;re not stuck inside that little building. 

As you get up and stand straight, you realize you can actually see over the roof of it. You look down at yourself. 

Sheesh, your entire body is just... not only are you taller, but you&#39;re THICKER. Your limbs, your core, everything has bulked up to help you support your additional weight. That must be why you&#39;re SO MOTHERFUCKING HUNGRY it&#39;s driving you nuts! 

You actually let out a little sob. You can feel yourself growing again, slower this time. Every time you get bigger, your stomach screams in pain for food, it NEEDS calories to justify so much growth. Augh! Your shirt and pants burst off almost simultaneously... you&#39;re in your little boxers now and they&#39;re so small, and you cringe at the thought of being naked and outdoors but... fuck, you&#39;re too big now!! 

You pull your boxers off and toss them aside. Hey. HEYyyy you&#39;re WAY bigger, hahaha... only trouble is, what the hell are you gonna be able to plunge this badboy into without causing a murder? 

You thunder along the pathway; you can&#39;t be any quieter anymore it seems. Your stomach alone is making enough noise to... ohh fuck. You&#39;re shaking again... you might not be growing, but... you stagger and fall to your knees for a second, and feel like your body&#39;s BURSTING with extra power. The hunger sears your insides but when you look at your hands, your arms, your legs... it&#39;s like you&#39;re being //pumped up,// like you&#39;re hulking out or something. You&#39;re turning into a BIG guy. You&#39;re getting BEEFY and bulky with extra muscle. It&#39;s not disproportionate though; you still seem to be built similar to your original frame, but you&#39;ve got to... 

A smell fills the air. Someone&#39;s cooking... something over a fire. Your eyes widen like a shark in pursuit of prey, and you zero in on the scent. Food. FOOD. FooD. FOoOoOOOOOD. 

[[FOOOOD-&gt;BigBoy End 2]] </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="417" name="BigBoy End 2" tags="badend GOO" position="328,2736" size="100,100">You see the slave cabins up ahead, and you charge into the cluster of little buildings like the ravenous beast err GROWING BOY that you are. There&#39;s a little campfire. There&#39;s... people here? 

They say some things to you but you don&#39;t care what they&#39;re saying, you are utterly starving and you, you, you GRAB the pack of hot dogs and those buns and those chips and eat. EVERYTHING. You toss the wrappers away. You can feel all the dogs n buns and everything, landing in your gut, and it sort of calms the hunger but not much! 

&quot;What the fuck, guy??&quot; says one of the men sitting here. 
You just growl and clutch at yourself as you grow again, leveling off around twelve feet tall. The little people are //saying things// but you don&#39;t give a fuck. 

YOU ARE SSTILL SOSOOOO HUNNNGGGRRRYyyyy
And all of these people are already like, way bloated-looking anyway. They don&#39;t need food. YOU need food. You rush away from the slave cabins, making the ground shake slightly. Fuck, you must have gained hundreds of pounds so far. You&#39;re just. Turning into such a BIG guy... You stagger and stumble as you move. Your body&#39;s doing a good job keeping your musclepower level with your height and overall mass, but you&#39;re not used to being so BIG. 

There&#39;s a blob. It&#39;s just poked out of the woods up ahead. No for real, a slime blob. It&#39;s green, and it looks like... 

like moving Jello. Mmm. You charge it and do a faceplant in it and start gobbling it up. Mmm. It doesn&#39;t taste like lime but you don&#39;t give a shit at this point, you&#39;re way too hungry. 

As the slime is sucked into your mouth, and fills your belly, you rub your nice full stomach happily and let out a little **burp** and... 

Ohhh goodness
[[You&#39;re about to grow some MORE.-&gt;BigBoy End 3]] </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="418" name="BigBoy End 3" tags="badend" position="456,2733" size="100,100">Holy crap, you digest the slime within a minute. A literal 60 seconds. Your body processes the creature and adds it to your mass, //rapidly.// You grunt and groan as you engorge, bigger than some TREES. You could probably climb up on the roof of the mansion without using the stairs. Just use the windows as footholds! You don&#39;t though. 

&quot;What the HELL??&quot; you hear Beau&#39;s voice saying down below. 
Mmmm. Look at that. A tiny little werewolf. Wait wait, he&#39;s like 10-feet tall! Is that //small// to you now? How... sheesh, how BIG have you gotten??!?

Mmmmm you pick him up though. You&#39;re still hungry. And he can&#39;t do shit about it; he can&#39;t break free of both of your hands. He protests and roars and begs, but you just... pop him into your mouth and gulp him down. 
You&#39;re //pretty sure// he might have intended to do the same to you. 

But that was when you were small. 
Beau plops heavily into your belly, stretching you round and plump, but you just sit back against a tree and rub and digest. Mmm. He might be shrinking in there... or just returning to his human form. 

You see a figure running out of the mansion up ahead... is that Eliza? 

&quot;Eeyyy what the FUCK mon??&quot; she yells when she sees you. She&#39;s got a flashlight in her hand. 

&quot;HHIIIII,&quot; you say in a booming voice. &quot;I got HUNGRY.&quot; 

And before she can react, you scoop her up as well... 

**GULP** 

With the two of them safely in your gut, you close your eyes for a minute. Mmm. You&#39;ll just... nap a little. 

**LATER** 

When you wake up, Eliza and Beau are standing a few feet away from you, glowing white and bickering about various topics, namely you, and something about... Beau&#39;s experiments? Huh. You didn&#39;t know he had it in him. Oh well. Heheh. They make cute little ghosts. 

Goodness gracious you are TALLER THAN THE MANSION now. You are a huge nude giant boy, manhood dangling for all the world to see, with great big thick Godzilla limbs and a dUMMy thICC beefcake body (the better to uphold your immense weight). 

You&#39;re still hungry though... 
Maybe there are more peeps to eat //outside// the swamp... lots of alligators, too... mm... 

**END** 

You have grown into a GIANT!! 
You are too big to rejoin civilization properly... and you&#39;re extremely hungry, for weeks afterwards until you reach full size-- roughly 150 feet tall or so, according to the government scientists who track you down to study you. 

Yeah, unfortunately, you weren&#39;t able to go unnoticed for very long. Enormous, sauropod-sized monstrosities like yourself are just not that good at hiding from superpowers with aerial and satellite imagery at their disposal. 

It&#39;s not all bad though. There&#39;s a special containment area set up for you; it&#39;s quite comfortable and peaceful and... and you have lots of people talking to you about things. It&#39;s a shame your brain&#39;s now so devoted to managing your vast body that it doesn&#39;t have much time for being, shall we say, &#39;very smart,&#39; anymore. 

But these scientist-dudes have a TON of tasty food for you. 
Maybe someday they&#39;ll be able to reverse this? 
For now you&#39;ll just enjoy being HUMONGOUS. </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="419" name="Mudpit" tags="SG" position="655,2378" size="100,100">SHIT!! 
You&#39;re covered in filth now. The mud is surprisingly warm. You wrestle free of the ghostly, swampy girl and... you pull yourself out of the squelching mud pit, at least enough to see and breathe properly. 

The girl comes up, too. She&#39;s no longer that proper ghostly-white color though. She almost glows //brown// now. Still pretty cute... She&#39;s giggling. &quot;Ain&#39;t no one come &#39;round to mud-wrassle with me for a long-ass time now... where y&#39;all been?&quot; 

&quot;Uhh... busy??&quot; you say, lamely. 

&quot;Too busy for theeeesse??&quot; she says with a coy smile and reaches up with both hands to press her boobs together. 

You grin right back at her. 

Looks like you&#39;re gonna play with this ghost girl a bit, huh?? 

Wait weren&#39;t you supposed to be doing something? 

Ahh who the fuck cares? Boobies! 

You [[launch yourself at her.-&gt;Mud Wrasslin&#39;]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="420" name="Mud Wrasslin&#39;" tags="SG" position="644,2507" size="100,100">The muddy ghost girl squeals as you land atop her and squish her into the mud. &quot;Ohh I luuuve me a man who takes charge,&quot; she says. 

You&#39;re not sure what happens next, but... somehow she flips you off her and ends up on top?? Everything&#39;s slippery and dark. Mmm she&#39;s nice and //strong,// too. That&#39;s kinda hot. It&#39;s like... a challenge. 

&quot;Lemme guess. Grew up with all older brothers?&quot; you ask her, panting as she straddles your waist. The ground bubbles underneath you both. A few other bubbles arise on either side. BIG bubbles, too, like, child-sized. 

&quot;Grew up with all YOUNGER brothers,&quot; she says, polishing her knuckles on her chest. &quot;Had to uhh, what they call it? Establish my DOMINANCE, hahahaha...&quot; 

You chuckle, yourself. Her ass feels great. 

What do you DO to her? 

[[Squeeze her ass.-&gt;SG AssGrab]] 

[[Flip her over.-&gt;SG Flip]] </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="421" name="SG AssGrab" tags="SG" position="520,2506" size="100,100">You slide your hands up her back for a moment, and then grip her ass, nice and firm. She&#39;s... she&#39;s got such a nice ass that you still haven&#39;t bothered to ask yourself &#39;how the hell am I actually touching a ghost?&#39; 

Seriously. She //feels// real. 
She titters when you squeeze her cheeks and slips sideways a bit. &quot;Ooo, you a //fresh// boy... come to MAMA--&quot; 

damn, she just freakin&#39; grabs your shoulders and rolls BOTH of you over in the mud. You&#39;re on TOP of her now. Also your shirt came off at some point?? 

You straddle her like she did you a moment ago, grinning. &quot;So who were you waitin&#39; for?&quot; 

&quot;Waitin&#39;? Oh. Just for any ol&#39; cute boy to come along,&quot; she says. Curiously, the mud doesn&#39;t seem to cling to her like it does you; it just discolors her ghostly complexion. 

&quot;Oh yeah? Why?&quot; 

&quot;So&#39;s I could do THIS,&quot; and she grabs your knees and tips you off-balance. Next thing you know, your pants slide RIGHT off. You scuffle around with her for a moment, both of you laughing like idiots, until she gives you a hard SHOVE and you land on a great big swamp bubble. 

She grins wide, showing all her teeth, and you gasp as you feel the swamp bubble shrinking underneath you [[as it empties itself into your ass.-&gt;SG GasStart]] </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="422" name="SG Flip" tags="SG" position="525,2383" size="100,100">You flatten her underneath your body and pin her wrists to the ground. &quot;Oooo, there&#39;s just somethin&#39; so SEXEH about a man who&#39;s strong enough to toss me around...&quot; 

You bite your lip and flex one of your arms; you&#39;ve never been built big but her flattery is making you feel like a bodybuilder. &quot;Yeah?&quot; 

&quot;YEAH!&quot; And then she twists sideways to toss you off-balance. Soon she&#39;s behind you, pulling your shirt off. &quot;I gotta get me a closer look, hun!&quot; 

&quot;Ohh NOO!! My modesty!&quot; you joke as you put up a small struggle. She peels your shirt off and tosses it aside, then starts rubbing your pecs from behind. 

&quot;Mmm. Boobies!&quot; she giggles into the back of your neck. And her hands slide down to your stomach. &quot;Hey, hey whatcha been eatin&#39; recently?&quot; 

&quot;Not much of anything, why?&quot; you ask with a little twitch. You grab her arm and flop her over yourself, but she&#39;s righted in seconds and charges you as you attempt to stand. 

&quot;Because, you&#39;re feelin&#39;--&quot; she slams into you and you fall back, landing on a big bulging swamp gas bubble. &quot;A little PUFFY!!&quot; 

Ok, 2 questions: When did your pants come off? And is that bubble [[GOING UP YOUR ASS??-&gt;SG GasStart]] </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="423" name="Pirogue Esc Start" tags="TRIM" position="154,3970" size="100,100">After probably twenty minutes worth of pushing that pole into the water and shoving the boat along, you round the southern tip of the island. You can just see the little boathouse off to your right, maybe... 50 yards away? 

Now, you came from the south. Which is... left. 
Fear starts to creep into your heart. You&#39;re actually doing this, aren&#39;t you? You&#39;re just going to paddle this //tiny// boat out there, into the darkness? Surrounded by the glowing vermillion eyes of hundreds of alligators? 

Ugh. Maybe you&#39;re safer with the ghosts and the Rougarou. 

You take a deep breath and start to push south. The boat&#39;s very quiet; the only sounds you make are faint trickling splooshes when you dip the pole in every few seconds. It&#39;s tiresome, for sure. 

A BRILLIANT idea strikes you suddenly. 
Your car. 
Your keys. 
Your keyfob. 
//The panic button.// 

You press it. Will it work from here? You hold it down for a while. 

Your heart swells in your chest. Hot fucking DAMN. You can hear your car alarm shrieking, far to the south. How the remote worked that far, you&#39;ve got no idea, but you start pushing your tiny boat through the bayou as fast as you can. 

[[And your car gets louder and louder.-&gt;Pirogue Esc Final]] 

AN-TRIM</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="424" name="Pirogue Esc Final" tags="TRIM" position="154,4112" size="100,100">After a solid... perhaps, half-hour of pushing with the pole? The bottom of the little boat bumps into the shore. Your car&#39;s almost deafening in the clearing up ahead. You&#39;re exhausted and your nerves are shot to hell, but holy BALLS you&#39;ve made it. 

You turn your alarm off and positively sprint over to your beloved car. You actually cry a little once you&#39;re inside and seated in preparation to drive. You don&#39;t turn the car on right away; you give yourself a little while to decompress. It&#39;s been a long night. 

You finally start your car, and [[pull away from the clearing.-&gt;Esc Chase RG]] </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="425" name="Esc Chase RG" tags="RG TRIM" position="152,4247" size="100,100">It&#39;s dark along the dirt road, and the thick trees prevent you from seeing very far. It wasn&#39;t a problem earlier but it&#39;s harder in the dark, and there are some patches of mud here and there that your wheels splash into. Your car lurches along steadily though. 

You hear something. 

You stop for just a moment, and roll your window down to listen. 
Is that... that&#39;s an airboat. Back behind you. 

And //those are werewolf footsteps.// Fucking SHIT, he&#39;s here!! 

You put your window back up and gun the engine. You don&#39;t see the Rougarou yet, but you know he&#39;s coming, and sooner or later-- 

THERE, in the woods, way back. That huge black shape. Those gleaming eyes. 

In your rearview mirror. 

Your instinct is to go FASTER. It&#39;ll get you away from the Rougarou-- he may be a supernatural monster but he&#39;s a living being as well, and he&#39;ll get tired long before you run out of gas. But the darkness and the close trees and small muddy road... are risks. 

Of course, if you go SLOWER, you&#39;re taking an even bigger risk of the Rougarou catching up to you. He&#39;s not limited to the roads like you are! But you know what they say, slow and steady wins the race, especially when visibility&#39;s low and the road&#39;s a twisty-turny route through swampy lowlands. 

[[Must go faster. Must go faster.-&gt;Esc Chase Crash]]

Your speedometer ticks up steadily. Hahaha, you&#39;re LOSING him! Ok ok. Relax a second. Some of these curves are a little sharp, and there&#39;s some mud in the road... 

You round another curve. Ok ok ok! This is easy! You pick up speed. 

You look off to your left-- 

FUCK HE&#39;S COMING
He&#39;s cutting through the trees!! He&#39;s not even sticking to the road! 

FUCKING CHEATER!!

You press the pedal harder and your car responds enthusiastically, giving you a burst of speed. You hand-over-hand the steering wheel as you come to another curve, and then-- 

no, nonono!! The back end of the car fishtails, and you turn the steering wheel back the other way-- 

FUCK
**CRUNCH** 

[[The car comes to a complete stop.-&gt;Esc Catches You]] </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="427" name="Esc Gold" tags="RG goodend" position="25,4240" size="100,100">You take the next corner carefully. Ohh shit he&#39;s catching up!! But this corner is too sharp for you to... ssshhhiiit you see the big dark monstrous shape go FLYING past behind you, skidding on some mud. FUCK! 

You speed up a bit to put some distance between you and him. You come to another corner though, and you slow down, as if you were driving on snow. 

The Rougarou comes POUNDING after you, terrifying in the night with his glowing eyes... 

And you make the turn. 
And he... he //misses.// 
What?? 

Why isn&#39;t he like, running ahead to lead you? To cut you off? If you RAM him, you&#39;re totaling your car... and probably him, too, but you bet he&#39;s sturdy enough to be super-pissed off about it and kill you once you crawl away from the wreck. 

So you just keep going. 
You glance at your rearview mirror. 
Beau&#39;s charging forward again. 

He&#39;s ALMOST ON YOU-- your back tires hit a patch of mud and kick it up into his face. He shakes his head and closes his eyes, and then his feet skid out from under him. 

He busts his ass in the mud. Snarling, the Rougarou tries to right himself. He looks around, sees your taillights pulling away, and lunges. 

And he falls flat on his face in the mud. He pounds a fist on the ground. 

You don&#39;t see if he falls again. He probably does though. You&#39;re almost out of the swamp entirely. Up ahead is asphalt. 

As soon as you hit it, you FLOOR IT. Your car&#39;s engine flares and you speed off like you&#39;ve just entered hyperspace. You can almost see the stars distort around you. 

In the mirror, you can see a muddy monster stumble out of the treeline, roar in your direction, and then lope back off into the woods. 

You. Fucking. Did. It. 
Epic. 

**END** 

You make a SEXY damn video when you get back home. Well-edited, revealing, not as much footage as you would have liked given the fact that your battery ended up dying later in the night, but hey. It happens. 

The subscribers go up, and up, and up! And so does your bank account. 

... unfortunately some of your subscribers decide to visit Bayou Lourde themselves, and //their// videos are, well... um, let&#39;s just say they&#39;re advertiser-inappropriate. You especially cringe at the video that pops up on Beau&#39;s channel, featuring a group of friends-- YOUR subscribers-- wrapped in his furry clutches, bellies swollen and kicking with werewolf pups. 

But on the bright side, you get a mysterious email from someone rather, um. Official. Asking you to meet and discuss your findings, discreetly, and with hints of making your channel&#39;s income look like a drop in the bucket if you&#39;re willing to take the next step in your &quot;paranormal investigator&quot; career. 

Sounds like a fun time, no?

Thank you guys SO MUCH for playing this initial release of //The Inflation Plantation//! I hope you had fun with it; I know I had a blast learning how to make a proper Interactive Story. Believe me, if I could program an actual video game, I would, but this is the next best thing, I think. 

I will reiterate what I surely confessed on Tumblr, Twitter, Deviantart, etc.: This is the official, &quot;day of Halloween&quot; release of the story, 
**but it is not the final version of the game.** I got pressed to meet my own deadline, and decided to make a few cuts here and there. I didn&#39;t like doing it, but the alternative was to fail to release this thing on Halloween like I&#39;ve been talking about for the previous few months. 

So, if you see any AN-TRIM&#39;s during scenes, those are indicators that content in that area of the story was cut, and //will be returned// to the story at a later date. It&#39;ll be like a &quot;Director&#39;s Cut&quot; edition. Cut content will be added back in, and certain scenes that I rushed myself to finish will be properly fleshed out or just polished up. 

If you enjoyed this and think I deserve a tip, you can go to https://www.patreon.com/Lamarcodon where I have basically an open tip jar. No rewards or paywalls, it&#39;s strictly an optional tip jar for anyone who wants to donate. 

Again, thanks for playing! Happy Halloween!

You just wrecked your car, didn&#39;t you? 

You take a look around. 
There&#39;s a tree, right next to your rear right wheel. It looks like you spun out and the tree hit your ass, stopping you cold. The car&#39;s still running, idling quietly. 

You&#39;re alright. Car&#39;s alright. Just-- 

The Rougarou SLAMS into your side and suddenly your door is wrenched open. 

His huge head pushes into the car above you. &quot;Sumbitch smol fren, I wasn&#39;t tryna&#39; wreck ya! You ok??&quot; 

He sniffs you and before you can react, he grabs you around the chest and under your arms in his massive hands and pulls you up out of your seat. &quot;Lemme just look ya over, I&#39;d feel terrible if somethin&#39; happened to ya...&quot; 

&quot;LET ME GO YOU HILLBILLY RETARD!!&quot; is the only thing you can think to spit out at him. Not that you&#39;re really //thinking,// given how you just, you know. Crashed your car into a tree. 

&quot;Sshhh shh sh shhh...&quot; Beau cradles you like a baby. &quot;I really am sorry. I wasn&#39;t tryin&#39; to get you in a wreck, I guarantee. You look like you alright though.&quot; 

He hugs you close. You are completely surrounded by warm fur and bulging muscles. &quot;Don&#39;t worry. Don&#39;t worry. I gotcha.&quot; 

... ok it&#39;s actually kinda soothing. 
At least, it is until Beau flattens you on the roof of your car with your legs dangling in the open driver side doorway, and [[tugs your pants off.-&gt;Esc Catches Fuck End]] </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="430" name="Esc Catches Fuck End" tags="RG end" position="418,4252" size="100,100">&quot;NoNONO WAIT!!&quot; you yelp, but Beau rumbles gently above you to soothe you (it doesn&#39;t really WORK) and nuzzles your cheek and pulls your legs open wide. 

&quot;Shhhhhh. I been waitin&#39; for this moment all night.&quot; 

You yell out in terror as you see his hefty package aimed right for your tiny little hole, drooling precum, //slobbering// it all over your crack... 

And then Beau enters your bowels. 
No matter how hard you clench, you can&#39;t keep him out. He&#39;s too strong, too big, and too //slick.// Werewolf precum must be one of the most effective lubricants you&#39;ve felt on any part of your body, ever. Sssooo at least there&#39;s that. 

&quot;I hope you&#39;ll come back and visit me someday, lil buddy,&quot; Beau croons as he caresses the side of your face. 

&quot;WHY.&quot; you grunt. &quot;THE FUCK.&quot; your body spasms. &quot;WOULD. I. DO. THAT.&quot; You pound your fist into the roof of your car. 

&quot;Well nah. &#39;Cuz o&#39; this.&quot; And Beau arches his body over you, and you feel his warm fur against your back... and quiet suddenly, inexplicably, you have the world&#39;s scariest boner. 

Your eyes pop wide open and you go completely rigid, both your body AND your peen. Your mouth gapes. You slowly turn your head back to look at him, maybe question him. 

&quot;That&#39;s why,&quot; Beau chuckles. 
He&#39;s... he&#39;s flipped a switch. He fucking turned you gay or something. You can&#39;t even... 

there&#39;s a huge werewolf dick inside you and it just poked some weird little pressure point or something and now you just wanna get fucking railed all night

Beau gives a little thrust, poking that spot again, and you

SQUEAK

&quot;I knew you&#39;d come around,&quot; he laughs. &quot;Nobody ever forgets what it&#39;s like gettin&#39; fucked by a Rougarou, I guarantee.&quot; 

&quot;OOohhh...OHH!!&quot; is all you can really say as he begins to cum in your tummy. &quot;OooOoooOOOhh... OOO!! Ohh OHH OH OHHH... OHHH BEAU!!!&quot;

You make a SEXY damn video when you get back home. Well-edited, revealing, not as much footage as you would have liked given the fact that your battery ended up dying later in the night, but hey. It happens. 

The subscribers go up, and up, and up! And so does your bank account. 

And, umm... so does your belly. 
You didn&#39;t want to admit it at first. But uhh... when you drove off with a belly loaded with Beau&#39;s hot steamin&#39; spooge, uhh... yeah. That somehow... well. You&#39;re looking at the results right in front of you. You watch yourself get bigger and bigger every day. You have a werewolf growing inside you! 

... and unfortunately some of your subscribers were a little INSPIRED by your video, and decide to visit Bayou Lourde themselves, and //their// videos are, well... um, let&#39;s just say they&#39;re advertiser-inappropriate. You bite your lip and blush at the video that pops up on Beau&#39;s channel, featuring a group of friends-- YOUR subscribers-- wrapped in his furry clutches, bellies swollen and kicking with werewolf pups. 

They actually email you, because... you leave a comment. Hinting that something similar may have happened to you as well. You sit reading their email with a hand on your swollen tum, feeling the contents shifting around in there... ooof. Beau knocked you the fuck UP didn&#39;t he? And... 

gosh, you kinda like it hehehehehe. 
You kinda like it enough to consider the offer your suscribers are proposing: head back to Bayou Lourde for a, um. Camping trip with them. 

Sounds kinda fun? And you&#39;ll get to let the kid meet his father! 
You shiver. 
... maybe it&#39;s actually kid-S??

[[THE END]] </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="431" name="SG GasStart" tags="SG" position="381,2510" size="100,100">You sink down into the mud, OVER the bubble as it **FWWOOSHES** up inside you. You grit your teeth. You&#39;re cringing hard as you look up at the muddy ghost girl. 

She just floats there grinning down at you. &quot;Ooopsie!&quot; 

You make a shaky attempt at standing up, which ends with your feet slipping out from under you and you land on your back. You prop yourself up on your elbows and wince down at the sight of your abdomen slowly inflating with swamp gas. 

She&#39;s RIGHT there, her hands on your stomach, laughing and giving you some wet smooches along your neck and chest. 

&quot;How do I, umm, how do I get this oouutt--!!&quot; Her tongue invades your mouth at that point and she starts making out with you. Down south, you feel her crotch grinding hard on your gas-filled stomach. 

&quot;It&#39;s been sooo LONG since I got to blow me up a nice boy,&quot; she gushes between kisses. She strokes her hand through your hair. &quot;You gonna blow up into a nice big ball for me hun?&quot; 

&quot;Wha--?!&quot; But you don&#39;t get a chance to answer, as she clamps her mouth on yours again... it feels like she&#39;s //blowing into you// as she makes out with you, and... 

ohh fuck. 
Your stomach is being //pumped full of air.// Gas. Swamp gas. The bubble... it&#39;s growing inside you!! 

You: 

[[Scramble away, try to escape!!-&gt;SG Esc Fail]] 

[[Fight back, play dirty!!-&gt;SG Kissback]] 

[[Ahh fuck it, let her have her way...-&gt;SG GasEnd]] </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="432" name="SG Esc Fail" tags="SG end" position="388,2378" size="100,100">Panicking as you feel yourself filling up, you backpedal hard with hands and feet working in tandem to scoot yourself backwards. 
Fuck, she just comes with you!! She&#39;s... you gotta keep moving! You yelp and pull away harder. 

She takes the opportunity to kiss you some more, blowing down your throat all the while and increasing the pressure in your guts. You whine as you feel yourself becoming bloated, and... and growing... ugghh... 

&quot;Mmm you might be a big boy now, but I&#39;m gonna make you a REAL BIG boy...&quot; 

And for just a moment, she sinks her crotch down over your manhood and draws you in. FFFFUCK. 

Ohh fuck she&#39;s got you now. Her ghost-pussy sucks you in, //slurps// you in greedily like she&#39;s eager for a taste... 
And then she pulls off you, the incorrigible //tease// that she is. 

&quot;You ready to be my big. BIG. Boy??&quot; she asks, before leaning in to kiss you once more. 

You grunt and groan and moan. 
[[You are blowing up into a //balloon//!!-&gt;SG GasEnd]] 

</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="433" name="SG Kissback" tags="SG" position="250,2513" size="100,100">You growl as you feel your stomach bloat with gas; it&#39;s a bit painful like you&#39;ve drank too much carbonation, but you&#39;ve also got this weird boner going along with it. 
Fuck. 
You hope she hasn&#39;t just twisted your libido to enjoy this sort of thing... regardless, you&#39;ve gotta top her! You wrap your arms around her upper body and clamp her tightly to you for a second. 

&quot;Ooooo... //peecccsss,//&quot; she squeals happily. Once you pull her face out of your cleavage, you waste no time in giving her a taste of her own medicine, smooching her hard, getting your tongue in there to wrestle... and then you //blowwwwwww// 

&quot;OOO YOU DIRTY BOY YOU,&quot; she shrieks as she pulls away laughing and moaning. She sits up on top of you and looks down at her tummy in surprise. 

She&#39;s bulging out like she&#39;s at least 3 months pregnant. &quot;Look what you DID to me... you, you, you STUD you. How am I gonna explain this at church??&quot; 

You... your natural instinct is to frown and go &#39;what the fuck&#39; but you&#39;ve got momentum on your side and you can&#39;t let it falter! So you lunge and slam her down in the mud and bend in to kiss her some more. 

You grind your dick against her swelling belly for good measure. The more you blow into her, the less tight-and-bulgy your own stomach feels. She puffs up beneath you, squirming and squealing and giggling and twitching. 

You keep blowing until she looks like she&#39;s got twins ready to pop out, and then you sit back and get off her, propping one hand behind you and lounging sideways. You give her a smirk. &quot;... uh oh, there, sweet-tits. How many kids did I put inside you??&quot; 

&quot;Ohhohohooohoo,&quot; she gushes. She cuddles her bloated gut and flops back in the mud. Her hands rub all over herself. &quot;Ohh you, you manly //stud// you... you nice big boy... how am I gonna FEED these, these babies... oof!!&quot; 

&quot;Ok ok, so. I think we&#39;re done now,&quot; you say. 

&quot;Ohh alright,&quot; she pouts, but she sits up and she&#39;s still clutching herself, and her smile is so bright it washes away all the brown in her ghostly aura. In fact she&#39;s probably the brightest glowing ghost you&#39;ve seen all night. 

You cringe and squint your eyes. &quot;Hey, you&#39;re not like, actually pregnant, right?&quot; 

&quot;Aww no silly, I may be a down-home church girl but I know how BABIES are made for real... just playin&#39; witcha.&quot; She leans on her swollen gut and beams at the sky above. &quot;I had fun.&quot; 

Your stomach gurgles a bit. &quot;This is, uhh... gonna leave, right?&quot; 

&quot;Ohh, right. Stand up,&quot; she says, and she does likewise. 

Heheh. Fuck dude. You blew her the fuck UP. Her gut&#39;s just hanging off her like-- ok ok. You stop staring and [[stand up.-&gt;SG Success]] </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="434" name="SG GasEnd" tags="SG end" position="250,2384" size="100,100">There&#39;s nothing you can really do against a pretty girl who wants to hold you down and kiss you, is there? As you feel the gas in your belly expanding out of control, you can only flop down and let her kiss the everlovin&#39; fuck outta you. She keeps dry-humping your gut, too, even as you bloat up bigger and bigger. &quot;Ooof!&quot; she squeaks, as she slips down along your chest and locks lips with you again. 

Ohh... ooff... //geez// you&#39;re blowing up really fast now!! You grunt as you feel your belly ballooning upwards, swelling into a tight round ball the size of... 

Fuck, it&#39;s BIGGER THAN SHE IS. 

She could literally fit inside you. The ghost girl lets out a &quot;whoooo!!&quot; as the rest of your body starts to inflate as well. She grabs your shoulders and pulls you forwards-- you&#39;re much lighter than you look, it seems. Or perhaps that&#39;s the gas helping you rise... 

Fuck, what if you float away!!

She sits you on your ass, upright, and you can&#39;t see your feet but you can feel your belly expanding in all directions-- no, it&#39;s your entire body, really. You&#39;re not even... like at first, it was just your abdomen bloating up, but now you&#39;re like doin&#39; the full //Willy Wonka//, except without the blue color. You whimper. 

&quot;Mmm. I love me a cute balloony boy.&quot; The ghost girl gives you one last smooch on the cheek. &quot;You gonna stay here with me for awhile, hmm? And I&#39;m gonna play with you...&quot; 

And with that, she does a somersault backwards in midair, and gracefully dives //straight into your navel,// which pops out a second later like the indicator on an opened jar, and you cry out in fear as you continue to become spherical... 

**END** 

You have been FILLED with SWAMP GAS!!

... and a ghost girl. 
Who is... basically now, your girlfriend? Kinda? 
Or really, it&#39;s more like, YOU are HER boyfriend. Because, not only is she inside you, but she seems to have total control over, umm... your gaseous new properties. 

To put it bluntly, she can now control how bloated you are. At will. As long as she&#39;s inside you or touching you. She spends all night fucking your engorged, Jovian figure, getting her jollies off... and then in the morning she blows you up to literally hot-air-balloon proportions and 

and I can&#39;t stress this enough

//flies you. over. the swamp. back. to your car.// 

When you land, she deflates you and hops out of your body to kiss you some more. You manage to grab her and hold her off you for just a minute. &quot;Ok look, //Ellie Mae,// if that even IS your real name--&quot; 

&quot;ExCUSE me, it&#39;s Sally Jean.&quot; 

&quot;WHATEVER!!&quot; you say. 

She touches your belly, which instantly plumps up to the size of a beach ball. &quot;Heheh. You&#39;re cute when you&#39;re flustered.&quot; 

You shiver. &quot;I... I came here to get footage of ghosts and stuff... and my phone&#39;s ruined.&quot; 

&quot;So we&#39;ll drive into town and find a payphone then!&quot; she says happily, and she lets your stomach shrink back to normal, but she also dives back inside you. &quot;C&#39;mon baby, road trip!!&quot; 

&quot;I... wait, what decade were you even born in??&quot; you ask. 

&quot;The 60&#39;s, hun!&quot; 

&quot;Not the //18//60&#39;s, I hope...&quot; you say as you get into your car and start it up. 

This is gonna be... a WHOLE new chapter in your life, isn&#39;t it? Maybe you can come back here some other time to get ghostly footage, like... now that you have a ghost living with you who can just pufferfish you if any hungry werewolves attempt to eat you. 

Oh THAT&#39;s gonna be embarrassing the first hundred times she does it in public. 

Hey! Maybe you can write a book. //Living With Gassy Ghost Girls// or something like that. 

... at least she&#39;s a killer fuck. And you can&#39;t even get her pregnant! Bonus! </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="435" name="SG Success" tags="SG" position="642,2628" size="100,100">&quot;Ok c&#39;mere,&quot; she says, and she clasps your midriff for a moment. Then she pulls her hands apart, and sitting there in her hand you see a growing bubble of slippery brownish gas. &quot;There we go! All gone.&quot; She tosses the ball over her shoulder, where it lands with a PLOP in the mudpit. 

You locate your clothes-- covered with mud, just like you are. 
And you about have a heart attack. 
That&#39;s your wallet, your car keys, your phone. Soaked in mud. 
&quot;FUCK!!&quot; You gasp as you fish them out of your pants pocket. 

&quot;Oh hey now, watch your language!&quot; she says with a giggle. 

&quot;No, for real, my wallet, my phone, they&#39;re ruined!!&quot; you sit in the grass and lament your losses. &quot;I--&quot; 

&quot;Ohh you got too much mud up in there? Here I got an idea,&quot; she says. &quot;Come gimme a kiss. Make me REAL big.&quot; 

&quot;.... make you big?&quot; 

&quot;Make me BIG, honey!!&quot; she holds her arms open wide. &quot;C&#39;mon! Blow me up until you can walk inside me!!&quot; 
Does... wait a second. Is she actually acknowledging the fact that she&#39;s a ghost? Because... you&#39;re pretty sure none of the ghosts you&#39;ve encountered so far have been able to do so, at least not without showing some hostility about it... 

Well if it&#39;s what she really wants... You go up and grab her and pull her into a nice passionate kiss. Except you blow into her mouth. And you blow, and blow, and stop to inhale, a big deep breath, and //blow// until you feel her entire body squishing against you and you can&#39;t get your arms around her anymore. 

Damn. Hopefully no one ever finds out you made out with an inflatable girl, right? Riiight? Haha. 

&quot;Ok hun now just, get yer clothes and little toys n stuff, and walk on through me. All the mud will come offa you and get on me!&quot; 
You do as she says. As you pass through her, you feel... both very cold, and yet very clean. 

She turns an earthy, chocolate-y brown. A big ball-shaped chocolate-lookin&#39; girl. She giggles and wiggles and burps. &quot;Ooo, see? Look how CLEAN you are.&quot; 

It&#39;s true. You&#39;re clean, and dry. And more importantly, [[your personal effects are unharmed.-&gt;SG Leave]] </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="436" name="SG Leave" tags="SG" position="775,2631" size="100,100">You thank her, and give her one last little kiss with some extra air to fluff her up some more. She titters and waves her hands. &quot;You naughty boy...&quot; 

&quot;What&#39;s your name? I might call you sometime,&quot; you joke. 

&quot;Sally Jean,&quot; she says dreamily, eyeing you up and down as you get dressed. 

You tell her your name, which she starts to repeat... over and over again, even as you tell her good-bye and return the way you came, [[back to the main path.-&gt;RearNorth Hub2]] </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="437" name="FBG Partytime" tags="FBG" position="363.3333333333333,1995.3333333333333" size="100,100">As you step a little closer to the heat-less, ghostly bonfire, a brawny arm drapes over your shoulders and you get a faceful of beer breath. &quot;S&#39;up, duude!&quot; says a handsome jock boy. You can actually feel the ghost&#39;s weight, he&#39;s a BIG guy. &quot;You new? Ohh shit you&#39;re a freshie aren&#39;tcha. You know what that means!!&quot; 

And he grips your wrist and holds your arm high. &quot;GUYS!! FRESHIE INITIATION!!!&quot; 

&quot;Dude nonono I&#39;m not--&quot; you try to pull your arm away. You kinda succeed, but the ghost jock wraps you in his muscular arms and wrestles you over to a keg. 

&quot;Freshies gotta be the drunkest people here, bro,&quot; he laughs. The other jocks and fratboys yell and laugh in agreement. 

&quot;Dude I&#39;m not a freshie! I&#39;m... uhh, I gatecrashed!&quot; you say quickly. 

&quot;Ohhhh, //gotcha// bro!&quot; he says, letting go of you and ruffling your hair. Damn, these guys are touchy-feely. 
Of course. They&#39;re all drunk, so that&#39;s probably why. You definitely see more than //one// no-homo-bro display of affection in the burnt clearing... 

&quot;Well. Shit dude. You should still be... properly SLOSHED if you wanna party with us!&quot; says another fratbro nearby, passing you a ghostly white Solo cup full of foamy beer. 

You take the cup and stare down into it. The jock-dudes nearly gaze at you expectantly. 

... you gonna drink ghost-beer? 

[[&quot;Nahh I&#39;m not thirsty, I&#39;m just looking for someone.&quot;-&gt;FBG Gangbang]] 

[[&quot;... ok, sure why not.&quot;-&gt;FBG Drink]] </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="438" name="FBG Gangbang" tags="end FBG" position="367,1870.3333333333333" size="100,100">&quot;Aww dude, so am I, bro,&quot; the guy just to your left says, and he too puts a ghostly arm around your shoulder. &quot;So. Am. I.&quot; He tips his drink back. 

&quot;Well hey, if you&#39;re not gonna drink,&quot; says the first fratbro, &quot;Maybe you could do us all a favor, eh?&quot; he chuckles and gives you a friendly shoulder-punch. 

&quot;A... favor?&quot; 

&quot;Yeah, man,&quot; he says. 
He grabs your crotch. 

&quot;WHOA whoa whoa whoooaa,&quot; you say, backing up a bit and laughing with your hands out. &quot;Nope, nope, nope. Not here for that--&quot; 

Except, the ghosts simply float along with you. 
You feel a beefy chest press into your back and thick, strong dudebro arms wrap around your body. Another bro comes up to... tickle your pickle a bit. He looks up at you happily. &quot;Just tell us when you want us to //stop,//&quot; he laughs. 

&quot;I, I want you to stop RIGHT NONOOOWWWW??!?&quot; your voice heightens into a shocked-and-somewhat-offended wail as the big bro behind you sticks his ghost-peen straight inside. Right through your jeans. He humps and humps and humps. And he fits, too... because he&#39;s a ghost, and-- 

&quot;WWAAAIITT!&quot; you yelp. He just bends you over and hangs you there in his arms, fucking you. FUcking. FUCKING. You. Fucking. 

&quot;Me next!&quot; says a ghost-bro. 
&quot;No, me!&quot; says another. 

The one behind you finishes up. You feel his chilly cum flush into your bowels, and then he sort of just passes you to the next guy in line. 
&quot;NnoonononoNOONO!!&quot; you try to protest, but the next beefy jock-ghost is already sliding in and thrusting his hips against you. 

You squirm and thrash to no avail. Even if they //weren&#39;t// ghosts, you&#39;d be getting fucked; they&#39;re too strong for you to escape their muscular, well-honed bodies. 

&quot;Mmmfff, what a NICE lil fuck. Here bro.&quot; 
&quot;Thanks bro, I&#39;ll take &#39;im.&quot; 
&quot;Heheh, hey pass him over here, flip him over! I wanna see his face.&quot; 

**LATER** 

You get. fucked. a. lot. Lots and lots of BIG guys. Some smaller but equally strong guys. Guys of all shapes and sizes! And... well, not really COLORS, seeing as how they&#39;re all a ghostly white glow, but... you can tell that there&#39;s a decent mix of ethnicities... 

point is, you collect a veritable potpourri of cold, thick, sloshy ghost spooge in your tummy. As the party wears on, the moon begins to dip, and the lower it gets, the bigger and bloatier your poor stomach grows. Each ghost dude only has about as much cum as any normal, LIVING dude his size, but... there&#39;s a lot of horny ghost fratbros here. A lot. And most of them come back for another round... or two. 

You pass out at some point, bulging and panting with heavy pressure weighing your body down, limp in the burly arms of so many virile bros... 

**END** 

You have been STUFFED with enough jizz to drown a horse! 

You wake up just as the sun is rising. There is no sight of the undead saturnalia whatsoever, save for... ohh FUCK. 

Save for the HUGE round belly they&#39;ve left you with. Fuckin&#39; hell, it&#39;s going to take you forever to squeeze all this gross-ass CUM out of your butt!! Uggh you feel like you&#39;re fuckin&#39; pregnant or something... 

You are NOT pleased to see Beau-- ok, well, you ARE, but you&#39;re not pleased that he gets to see how FAT the fratbros made you. 
And he&#39;s not happy about it either, lamenting the entire boat ride back that &quot;it coulda been MINE! If you&#39;d just stopped runnin&#39; and let me breed you.&quot; Somehow you don&#39;t share his enthusiasm for interspecies werewolf relations, and he just can&#39;t figure out why. Funny world, ain&#39;t it? 

You just. Head on home and collapse into bed when you finally get back. Grumbling and grunting about your bulging tum. 
At least until the morning, when you realize that it&#39;s... it&#39;s shrunk a little, but it&#39;s also a lot more FIRM than it was before. Like. Liiiike holy shit you //actually are pregnant.// 
You don&#39;t believe it at first. You just tell yourself your body&#39;s reacting to um, a foreign entity inside. 

And then of course the baby starts kicking. 
And it could have been any one of them, to be honest. It&#39;s baby roulette up in here; most of the fratbros fucked you twice so-- wait, why does it matter whose it was? More importantly HOW IS IT GETTING OUT?? 

The answer to that question comes after three whole days of watching yourself swell to the obscene, protruding, distended size of a minivan tire. You feel like you&#39;re going to pop when you wake up that day, but after attempting and failing to get up, you start to rapidly deflate... 

And ghosts start shooting out of your ass. One by one. Fuck, you&#39;re like a machine gun. You fire ghost after ghost out of your butt, up into the empty air within your bedroom, and they sort of all float in different spots. They look like little orbs. Like... blurs. Clouds of ectoplasm. 

With backwards baseball caps on. 

They flicker in and out of sight, and a few of them always seem to hang out around you wherever you go. Most of them though, stay at your home, your apartment, //your hotel room,// wherever you&#39;re living at the time. Sometimes you hear them whispering things like &quot;bro&quot; and &quot;dude&quot; and &quot;no homo&quot; and &quot;my dude&quot; and &quot;fuck yeah bro&quot; and it&#39;s almost unbearable. 

At least they&#39;re kinda cute. Little ghosty-lookin&#39; fratballs. 
And they can phase inside people too, and like INSTANTLY get them tipsy and loose and happy... 

Sooo the trip wasn&#39;t a total loss! Plus you can still make your video... you&#39;re just not sure you wanna let all your subscribers know what happened to you, and what if any of them get ideas of going to Bayou Lourde themselves? 

... well. It&#39;s their ass, isn&#39;t it? </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="439" name="FBG Drink" tags="FBG TRIM" position="369,2120.333333333333" size="100,100">&quot;FFffuuuuuck yeah!!&quot; the dudes around you cheer, clapping you on the back as you throw the drink back. Unnfff you can already feel it working; it lands in your gut heavily and you&#39;re already slightly buzzed. Consuming ghost items seems to... oof. They just. They work faster. They do their job, y&#39;know? Probably means you&#39;ll be sobered up again quickly. 

The ghost-bros aren&#39;t though. &quot;Give him another!!&quot; 

And another cup is passed into your hands. 

You sway a little and throw it back at their encouragement. 

Ok NOW you&#39;re drunk. 
You WHOOO with the rest of them and happily accept the back-slapping and the chest-bumping. You&#39;ll fit right in, won&#39;t you? 

You slip into the crowd. With a cup in your hand and some booze on your breath and some BLUSH on your face, it&#39;s all-too-easy to mingle with these hedonistic young jocks. 

You spend some time talking to the various guys here-- the ones who will actually TALK to you for more than a few seconds, before getting distracted with more drinks or someone else&#39;s body they&#39;re suddenly interested in. There&#39;s plenty of uhh... free-lovin&#39; and huggin&#39; and touchin&#39; going on, that&#39;s for sure. 

You do learn a couple tidbits though. 

&quot;Uhh yeah bro,&quot; one of the jocks says to you between drinks. &quot;Sometimes he comes over here and eats a few of us, just for fun.&quot; 

&quot;The werewolf //eats// you guys.&quot; 

&quot;Ehh, yeah. Doesn&#39;t hurt us, doesn&#39;t hurt him. We pop back out awhile later, he kinda blows up a bit and gets drunk...&quot; 

And from another fratbro: &quot;Yeah some witch-doctor-lady said we shouldn&#39;t be here, like, we were gonna disturb the resting place of some... I dunno, some old dead chick. Like. Whatever??! Am I right?&quot; he laughs. He passes you a beer and you hang with him for a bit, drinking. &quot;What&#39;s she gonna do, //ghost// on us?&quot; he chuckles. He&#39;s built strong and cocky; exactly the kind of dude who thinks he&#39;s invincible. 

They all probably thought they were invincible. 
But they&#39;re all, um. Ghosts now. So they weren&#39;t. And they seem to be stuck here, partying, forever. Always drunk, always young and dumb. Is it a blessing or a curse? You wish you still had some phone battery left... 

A chunky ghost-dude accidentally bumps into you, spilling your beer. 
&quot;Awww shit bro, I didn&#39;t see you there... I&#39;ll go get you another one, man, I&#39;m real sorry.&quot; He disappears for like, two seconds, and then reappears. Right in front of you. Holding another ghost-beer.

You feel pretty... uhh... pretty //bloated,// but you also feel like you don&#39;t give a shit. You feel like you&#39;re just as buff and strong as any of these dudes. 

&quot;You from outta state?&quot; the chubby fratbro asks. 
&quot;Yeah dog,&quot; you say, slipping RIGHT into the proper lingo. It&#39;s like the beer turns everyone on bro-mode. &quot;UMass.&quot; 

&quot;UMass? Sweet dude.&quot; 

&quot;Nono. U-MASS,&quot; you say like a douchebag, flexing your guns. Which definitely feel much more impressive than they probably are. 

The guy laughs. &quot;Fucker. Hey so the guys are gonna see if they can go catch a gator or something.&quot; 

&quot;... a gator?&quot; 

&quot;Yeah bro, there&#39;s this little, like a canoe-boat-thing? A couple of the others found it in a little locked building up that way.&quot; 
He points off in the distance-- to the **NORTH**. Which means, if you&#39;re standing back on the main path facing North, you&#39;d want to go 

**NORTHEAST**
to get to the secret boathouse. 

&quot;So they&#39;re gonna like row it out there and try to bring us a real live alligator, isn&#39;t that awesome??&quot; 

&quot;That&#39;s sick,&quot; you say, downing the rest of your beer. Your belly plumps up a bit under your shirt with all the booze you&#39;ve drunk so far. &quot;Ugh. Hey I&#39;mma go take a piss. Back later.&quot; 

You stagger away from the bonfire scene, back towards the main path. Fuck, dude, how much did you drink? You look like you ate an entire turkey, bones and all! Luckily it seems to shoot right through you as quickly as it got you tipsy, so all you have to do is pick a tree, open your pants, and let it all gush out. Your stomach shrinks back to normal between your arms as you unload. As does your BAC level. 

Time to head [[back to the main path,-&gt;RearNorth Hub2]] with your new knowledge! </tw-passagedata></tw-storydata>
